__label__0 canada didn ' t bar any flights from coronavirus hot spots , we just upped our screening at the airports . it ' s been two months now and we ' ve had about two dozen confirmed cases out of 35 million people . i ' m aware of the outbreaks in iran / italy and agree that there ' s cause . . .

__label__0 so far in vegas local news i ’ ve only seen them report 1 possible case of coronavirus back in january and he was quarantined , but for a third time now i am hearing from people i know in the hospital that they currently have a patient in quarantine ( desert springs hospital ) .

__label__1 runny or stuffy nose a sore throat or sneezing . none of the major symptoms of a cold allergies or the flu . had a chest x - ray but it came back normal so i don ' t think it ' s pneumonia . i need to know for quarantine purposes of it ' s coronavirus
__label__0 i ' m sick of hearing about this crazy expenditure of money time and effort on this coronavirus it ' s no worse than the flu in fact it ' s less worse than the flu the only people that have to worry are the same people that have to worry about the flu . the elderly , people what ' s

__label__0 i understand people are worried about coronavirus , i get people are scared but bulk buying your local shops out of everything is stupid . and stealing from hospitals is absolutely vile and the most selfish thing i can think of , the hospitals need hand sanitiser / wash and masks .

__label__0 i ’ ve had numerous people tell me that they were in contact with someone who has the # coronavirus # covid 2019 and went to the emergency room but was denied testing and sent home !
__label__0 i ’ ll go deeper . gates was always an advocate for population control . last year he financed together with mike bloomberg a study about a simulation of a pandemic situation , now we are having coronavirus . he always works with laboratories for vaccines . . . that should raise eyebrows
__label__1 flying to denmark in a rush of coronavirus here is one of the most stupid decisions i ’ ve made . i should have stay home in ukraine ( where only one registered case ) . don ’ t make my mistake .
__label__0 the thing about the flu is the test for it is very accurate . so if people are tested for flu & amp ; are negative coronavirus is certainly a possibility , whether they test positive for # covid 19 or not . since japan , singapore , & amp ; france have all said to expect spread , we should too .
__label__0 hi . . . . in response to the escalating need for social distancing to slow the coronavirus we have decided to offer only takeout for the weekend through phone service and stop in . . . we will take orders and have them …

__label__0 not laughing . one of the things that led me to vote third - party in 2016 was djt reaction to bringing ebola doctors back to us . i ’ ve been in senegal since the day this coronavirus thing hit , and i ’ ve been praying that “ jessica ” s wouldn ’ t succeed in closing the country ’ s borders .
__label__0 right like i know that coronavirus most likely wont be a huge problem for me as i practice basic hygiene and whatnot and the issue in the us isn ' t as major as people make it out to be , but i also would rather not be hospitalized for pneumonia tbqh . might ruin my day a little
__label__0 a case of coronavirus in my state was diagnosed in a town just an hour and a half from me and people in my town are literally freaking out now . i ' m not gonna lie , the coronavirus worries me too more than the flu because it ' s got a much higher mortality rate so far .
__label__0 if the authorities are serious about forcing us doctors out of ( in my case semi - ) retirement in attempts to fight covid - 19 ( & amp ; in an attempt to reduce nhs pension expenditure by infecting vulnerable elderly people ) , i insist on being issued with one of these . # covid 19 # coronavirus

__label__1 i just love how i how got a sore throat when the whole coronavirus is happening 🙄 🤒
__label__0 like if they quarantine us , are they even gonna let ivan come down ? ? ? ugh fuck covid - 19
__label__0 jokes on you coronavirus . i ' ve been self isolating for my entire life !
__label__0 looking at buying plane tickets myself - good time to do it as this # coronavirus will eventually pass
__label__0 so that means we have to pay for coronavirus testing ? and for our hospital stay if we are found positive ? are they planning to make our health coverage reset themselves with their trumpcare plan ?
__label__1 also signs here saying that the airport is an identified zone for passengers with confirmed cases of coronavirus passing through so if cough develops on return home we need to self - isolate ! happy days !
__label__1 this is for everybody me and my friends have come in contact with that is visiting in korea , when i cough , it does not mean i have coronavirus / wuhan virus . even if u are saying this to me as a joke , it really is not funny . it is a serious thing so please stop

__label__1 so . all we know from my dr visit is i am sick . but i don ’ t have strep or the flu . but they also don ’ t have the means to test for coronavirus so i ’ m at home just taking anxiety medication and eating ice cream 🙃 🙃 🙃 🙃
__label__0 also as someone who will require a hospital stay within the next 2 months , it would be excellent to not have my hospital be totally full and overwhelmed . let ' s not cause people to die of entirely treatable non - coronavirus things .
__label__0 there are grown men who have children on here talking about lil uzi vert ' s album non - stop . we need a witch doctor on the tl asap . this is now a higher priority concern than the coronavirus .
__label__0 what are cruise ships doing w / their waste you ’ re likely to get # coronavirus oregano leaves held under your tongue can relieve symptoms . we need to be able to self - test , be more responsible make , better decisions . use our tax $ to pay bills , self - quarantine

__label__0 been in this hospital during my year stay in # seattle from 2007 . now a # coronavirus case is being reported at the same facility . 😮
__label__1 and many in nyc don ’ t have the option to drive anywhere . i have a family member w symptoms , but not going to give coronavirus to a taxi or uber driver ( & amp ; all their subsequent passengers ) to get tested . we need at - home or by mail testing for # nyccoronavirus
__label__0 i coughed at a blood draw center and a woman asked for me to be quarantined because i have coronavirus . no , m ’ am , i just choked on a sip of my water bottle , you ’ re just really stupid & amp ; that flimsy mask isn ’ t going to save you , anyway .
__label__1 so a lecturer joked about me having coronavirus bc i had chest pains this morning and didn ’ t attend class 😂
__label__0 62 americans have now succumbed to the # coronavirus . i don ’ t mention this number to fear monger — i share it because trump is still telling people this will blow over , not to worry . because tests are still not readily available and this admin continues to minimize the epidemic .
__label__0 i ate ass 🍑 and ain ’ t get sick i ’ m not scared of no damn coronavirus ☣ ️
__label__1 i just returned from brazil . no problem on planes or in airports , few people wearing masks . but coronavirus has not hitnthe americas so far . i think i might reconsider going to europe right now .
__label__0 travel at your own risk and when you get infected , just stay where you got that # coronavirus and don ' t come to spread it to us like some who went to # italy 🤔
__label__1 just went thru customs here in the us and was not 1 ) screened for symptoms 2 ) asked if i ’ ve been to high risk places 3 ) scanned for body temp . 4 ) asked literally anything relating to # coronavirus the notion that “ we are screening everyone ” is patently false .
__label__0 how is there not a single case in # indonesia # coronavirus maybe some aren ’ t telling the truth . maybe many of us americans have gotten sick from this already and thought it was just a virus ? # conspiracytheories
__label__0 my school really thinks we ’ re immortals because they ’ re forcing us to go to school even though the cases of coronavirus keep increasing here in cr . i know i ’ m gonna be okay if i get it but i seriously don ’ t wanna get sick and have to go through all of that alone .
__label__0 honestly - are y ’ all stockpiling toilet paper . . because you see everyone else doing it ? ! i mean . . how long do we plan to be quarantined ? or better - how much toilet paper do y ’ all go through ? # covid 2019 # coronavirus # coronavirusupdate
__label__0 do you know what ’ s involved in testing ? my son , a nurse , told me it ’ s a very invasive test that ’ s why they are not testing . they are testing for all other viruses first before doing coronavirus test . if you ’ re sick stay home .
__label__0 i can only hope this would be my doctor if i get coronavirus
__label__0 the us is assessing hospital bed capacity for # 2019 _ ncov # coronavirus right now . south africa should do the same . public and private . not enough to have 9 provincial designated hospitals .
__label__0 innovative # mobile # coronavirus testing in south korea . . . . this would work in la , and prevent us all from having to walk into a clinic if we ’ re not feeling well . they can test 380 a day how drive - through testing could limit coronavirus contagion

__label__0 if the mortality rate is 3 . 4 , and the flu is . 01 , does that mean the symptoms 34 times more severe ? will i struggle more to breathe as compared to a typical flu ? # coronavirus # cnntownhall
__label__0 also my coworker who doesn ’ t believe in modern medicine and comes to work regardless of her health status is sick again and i know it isn ’ t coronavirus but i wouldn ’ t bat an eye if we found out it was ( but it really can ’ t be ) .

__label__0 reason why i ’ m looking into all these cases popping up about coronavirus is cause i ’ m a barber & amp ; as a barber cutting a lot of people ’ s hair even some who come in saying they ’ re a little sick bro make me think deep about a lot of other shit & amp ; it simply just ain ’ t no joke

__label__0 so from what i ’ ve read it sounds like the only americans being tested are those with coronavirus symptoms and those who have been out of the country in the last 14 days or anyone who has come in contact with someone who tested positive . this will get worse before getting better .
__label__0 if anyone is gonna get the coronavirus , it ’ s me . i ’ ve already been sick for over 5 months . my immune system is nonexistent .
__label__0 guysssss pleaseeee , there are multiple strains of coronavirus so when you see so and so was diagnosed with coronavirus we don ’ t know if they ’ re referring to covid 19 in particular

__label__0 i got drunk and shot a deer . doctor said i have coronavirus and huntavirus .

__label__0 who ' s gonna be the first person from wrestling twitter to get coronavirus ? after this night i vote me because i went to some gross ass bars with some people who looked and smelled like they could carry a conversation about the long - term viability of aew if you know what i mean .
__label__0 so any given person has an * at most * 80 % risk of getting coronavirus ? ok then . . . . . 😶 feel like i should try and reduce my ( very close ) physical contact with people but that ’ s going to be hard , my break times at college thrive on it . 😭 😅

__label__0 the reason that the coronavirus numbers are not going up in the usa is because our failed government does not have the test kits . they are still only testing people that have visited china or have come in close contact with someone from china .

__label__0 this coronavirus thing is getting out of hand . i ’ m no doctor but i hope they can discover a cure for this . # coronavirus
__label__0 i think the wuhan quarantine is an experiment they are conducting . because a coronavirus has not the ability to create a pandemic . the virus in wuhan is zoonotic it came from bats . i believe influenza type a is the only one with the potential to a pandemic . . . .

__label__0 definitely ban the chinese tourist . our hospitals here in ph are not equip enough for the coronavirus .
__label__0 we are fine , stay at home , not going outside 💕 our government is actively taking many measures to deal with it . we trust our government & amp ; believe it will be restored soon . 💕 wish peace and safe for all people in the world . # china # wuhan # wuhanvirus # coronavirus # family # ileezon
__label__0 i sneezed on the tube today and apologised saying i ' d just come back from china . # coronavirus
__label__0 what they should do to protect the public from the # coronavirus is to tell us the date that the infected travelled , the flight number and the exact locations visited before being diagnosed . with a 7 day lag in symptoms , this is key information ! ! !

__label__0 i know yall worry about 2019 - ncov since we have one confirmed case already . this is a reminder that worrying bc our hospitals can ’ t handle an outbreak is very much different than plain ol ’ racism towards the chinese . they ’ re victims here too . blame the system , not the people .
__label__0 # coronavirus currently has a kill rate of 2 % , are we better off catching it now , getting treatment and surviving . rather than risking a global epidemic , when we can ’ t get into hospitals and the disease has mutated to be way worse ? can ’ t catch what you ’ ve already had 💊 💉 🧬 🦠
__label__0 coronavirus is scary , w / 8000 cases , 170 deaths worldwide . there is no prevention or treatment . the fear at this point is anticipation , as transmissions are mostly in china . the reality is influenza will cause more illness and death in the us . its not to late to get the flu vax 💉

__label__1 my coronavirus * has reached the coughing stage . ( * gentleman ' s flu ) .
__label__0 us to evacuate americans on cruise ship quarantined in japan from # coronavirus outbreak after dozens of people on board tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month .
__label__0 i can ’ t imagine the cruise ship industry all over the world not seeing a decline even after the covid - 19 # coronavirus runs its course . reputation as plague boats solidified .
__label__0 us to evacuate americans on cruise ship quarantined in japan from coronavirus outbreak
__label__1 i flew through the atlanta airport last friday and walked through the international terminal . i ’ ve felt terrible since monday . my brother almost has me convinced i caught coronavirus .
__label__0 two women at the bus stop were talking about the end times . coronavirus . and they kept looking at me . not sure if that was a type of proselytizing ? i started coughing
__label__0 let me edit this with i have the same amt of carry on i ’ ve had on every flight i ’ ve ever been on . minus my wedding dress , that they said they could hang no problem . then i get halfway down the runway and you ’ d have thought i was trying to smuggle the coronavirus on board
__label__0 suggested cure is a wedge of lime up your bum . just what i have been reading . consult your doctor first .
__label__0 interestingly the symptoms of the # coronavirus are identical to my post # sepsis syndrome symptoms barring the headache and dry cough . i have this everyday ! the world could do with getting a fucking grip and manning up . the human race really are an entitled bunch of wet ponces .
__label__0 oh , also the notion of “ total deaths ” - so not just those who die from the coronavirus but also those who die from * our response * to the coronavirus ( overcrowded hospitals , blockades , etc . ) ( would these qualify as “ second - order ” deaths ? i don ’ t entirely understand the term )
__label__1 today i have a little fever . . so turn off twitter today . now , in japan , the new coronavirus is spreading phenomenally . . so even a little fever is scary . . i try for physical condition recovery with medicine . please understand .
__label__1 i think it was two weeks ago at the start of our exams . . . i had you know , sore throat , headache , i had cold . catarrh and i even had cough due to my sore throat babahhhh your girl checked the coronavirus symptoms and saw that it was similar faa come and see prayer and repentance
__label__0 when i get sick she quarantines me like i got the coronavirus , but yet when she ’ s sick , she ’ s laying on me n shit
__label__0 if anything coronavirus has shown for travel sector , it is that mass cruise industry has to be completely rethought from the ground up . after these last few weeks , i don ’ t think the cruise industry will * ever * gain any first time new passengers , they certainly don ’ t deserve to .
__label__0 are you fn kidding me ? ? trump is saving us ? if anything , god send the coronavirus because he ' s sick of our bullshit ?
__label__0 i have the heathrow app still on my phone because of shawn ’ s flights and i just got something like 10 noititications on it about coronavirus . ok

__label__1 last night and i drank a corona at a party and she took a photo and joked about us having coronas , but not the coronavirus and literally 24 hours later i have a fever , body aches , chest pain , sore throat and lungs . . . .
__label__0 is this just for attention or the pretence that we are more human than others . we escaped ebola , and lassa fever is ravaging over 20 states and your gall of human kindness is to add coronavirus to it . bring them back and use your family home as quarantine . sannu
__label__1 japan is very wary of the new coronavirus . . i was examined at a hospital and found to have a cold . 😷 💦 i ' m still not in good shape but i ' m starting twitter today . 👍 💦 my dear kind larry , thank you for your concern . 🙏 💐 🌻 🌻 🌻 💐 🙏

__label__1 writing a policy analysis for coronavirus is acc so sooooooooooo interesting but check in with me in four hours and i ’ ll be lost in a writing wall and paranoia about my recent cough
__label__0 anyone with coronavirus hit me up . . . . . i could use 14 days in quarantine with # netflix
__label__0 wow ! a plane load of passengers landed in texas with at least two people infected with the coronavirus . i think flights from countries where this is prevalent right now should be halted for the time being . i don ' t care who disagrees .
__label__0 i hope that cruise ship and those cargo planes used to bring back americans w / coronavirus will be destroyed ; otherwise they will infect for years to come if used ! this is a virus and viruses cannot be eradicated ! they just go dormant until reactivated .
__label__0 hey looks like my coronavirus flight was updated ! my 12 hour layover in hong kong was changed . . . . . . to a 14 hour layover in hong kong . 😅 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♂ ️ on the plus side , i also get to spend 14 hours in vancouver . time to have some great seafood ! # coronavavirus

__label__0 our institutional policy of keeping people weak and vulnerable by treating symptoms with medicine will catch us out with # coronavirus # covid 19 # sarscov 2
__label__0 why are they not testing the # christmasisland evacuees for # coronavirus before they bring them home ? doesn ’ t seem very scientific to imprison them but then do such a bad job of quarantine . we already know that people can be asymptomatic carriers and incubation up to 24 days
__label__0 the virus is very scary , the fact that you can contract if from someone who isn ’ t even showing symptoms . . . god save us all - for a fact i know africa will crippled beyond 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 # coronavirus
__label__0 this is my argument . it ’ s like saying ‘ the illness ’ . the common cold is a coronavirus
__label__0 coronavirus has really opened up my eyes to all the different cruise options i didn ’ t know were available .
__label__0 almost everyday , about 100 people die from coronavirus in china . every region in mainland china is infected . uk , usa , france , even india evacuated citizens . right now , our airports allow chinese people in from china . when will the “ need ” arise to save nigerians trapped there ?

__label__0 beyond disappointed that and cut away from the doctors briefing us on the coronavirus at white house press briefing . they have the information that we need right now . media outlets need to take this more seriously .

__label__0 right . and if trump had a better relationship with the truth , i would . as it stands with the coronavirus , i would prefer any quarantines , border closures , vaccines , protocols , etc . be sanctioned by the cdc . my only point is we cannot rely on anything trump says .

__label__1 semi - satire moment someone kept coughing in the coffee shop and we all started to look around at each other , thinking they have the coronavirus .
__label__0 after asking my cards , i was told to go into quarantine on april 15 . if there isn ' t a nationwide quarantine by april 15 , you are being put at great risk for # coronavirus .

__label__0 what if # coronavirus is our planets answer to global warming ? 🤔
__label__0 why my pops just call me & amp ; ask if i was quarantined 🙄 so annoying , no & amp ; at least not yet # coronavirus
__label__0 📣 one positive thing to come out of this coronavirus pandemic - emergency is the need to hunker down for a while . i hope all those cruise 🚢 passengers spent their time wisely reading good books , not the telly ! • i like to read , i like to hunker , i enjoy my own company !

__label__0 if i end up in a hospital because of the coronavirus i am not going to pay any medical bills . put me in jail , i don ’ t care . and i will make the right to universal healthcare the battle of a lifetime . # coronavirususa # universalhealthcare
__label__0 could be any ards patient / severe pneumonia patient ’ s ct i guess . non - specific , like their symptoms . # coronavirus # foamed # foamcc
__label__0 an extraordinary insight into humanity ' s blindness . nitrogen dioxide is more lethal to our planet than this virus but it had not brought us to our senses . maybe now it will ! ? bbc news - coronavirus nasa images show china pollution clear amid slowdown
__label__0 canada ' s response is a joke . there should be bans to key countries . failing that immediate quarantine . our hospitals are overwhelmed & amp ; can ' t deal with this . # coronavirus # covid 2019 # cdnhealth # cdnpoli
__label__0 so i did a stupid . someone i work with asked how i was , i said , “ aside from dealing with a nasty ingrown hair i thought was staph for a sec , i ’ m good . ” suddenly i ’ m being sent home early because everyone started freaking out . coronavirus be making people extra spooked i guess .
__label__0 my step dad ordered our fam the n 95 masks bc he ’ s hella paranoid on the coronavirus but i feel like a super weirdo wearing it out in public but i went to the chinese ranch market and every single person like all the workers / everyone had a mask on lmao

__label__0 fuck i ’ m sick asf 😭 i think i got the coronavirus 😭
__label__0 part of yesterday evening ’ s glumness can probably be explained by the fact that i ’ ve woken up sick this morning . my body ’ s usual energy levels were probably depleted trying to fight off the virus . ( and no , it ’ s not coronavirus . it ’ s just a regular cold . )
__label__0 this coronavirus is about over my damn head rn . i ' m afraid we ' ll be quarantined , i don ' t need or want that to happen . 😷 . . . .
__label__0 i don ’ t like to wish illness on people but wouldn ’ t it be great if trump got coronavirus . # justsaying .
__label__0 i don ’ t understand what your beef is ? they did not test for coronavirus because there was no reason to . they did test for flu and found flu . that ’ s what made them sick . flu .
__label__0 how is our country so inept we can ' t make coronavirus tests that work or manufacture paper masks ? amazon is jacking up the prices of masks and they should be free . the masks you get at your doctor ' s office are made in china .
__label__0 yall niggas sick an i ain ’ t talking coronavirus 😷
__label__1 my boss and i were both sick with a cough , mild fever etc at the same time for over a week and she asked how i was feeling then told me she genuinely suspects we may have had coronavirus
__label__0 stop . you are misleading and politicizing . shame on you . btw , plz feel free to comment on ambassador birx role under pence as coronavirus response coordinator . i am sick and tired of people playing for political points .
__label__0 where when how and why did this disease coronavirus came out of how did it start coronavirus is gonna get us sick and i may die from that disease i was thinking the coronavirus is coming from the corona beers
__label__1 damn every bitch got coronavirus in this house , why we all coughing at 12 pm

__label__0 may allah save us from this bad sickness # coronavirus and save all the ummah in this world amen 🤲
__label__1 i have this terrible cold , no fever thank goodness otherwise i ' d be concerned i may have the coronavirus . getting sleep in small segments . sucking on cough drops , taking cold tablets , drinking lots of water . good news in 9 hours i get to watch baseball on
__label__1 i ' ve just had this horrendous flu with similar symptoms too . knocked me out for a week . lots of colds come from the coronavirus family , so could be a coincidence . but also maybe it ' s not y ' know . i mean what if man ? what if ?
__label__0 such bad timing for the treaty body session to be held in our region . samoa reduces flights and places additional clearance measures for entry in the country . # coronavirus
__label__0 received a letter from my doctor telling me i should self - isolate . nothing to do with being at high risk from coronavirus , i just apparently have a toxic personality ?
__label__0 trying to remember who on twitter is responsible for me now singing happy birthday twice each time i wash my hands . as someone who makes my living by my ability to travel doing my best to avoid being quarantined # washyourhands # coronavirus # besafe

__label__0 remember when we all were going to succumb to seemingly mild illnesses because we used antibacterial soap ? where ’ s that soap box ? 🙄 # coronavirus
__label__0 no way this coronavirus can defeat us now ; went to stock up and now expect to live on 20 tins of tomato paste and 15 packs of ginger biscuits . . ( ? ) # stockingup
__label__0 are you guys going to give any support to us delivery people out here know that the coronavirus 🦠 covet 19 has arrived in the us or will you leave us to fend for ourselves ? we are terrified and have no supplies and no education if we get sick doing this job who will support us ?
__label__0 with this coronavirus going on i ' m really not trying to hop on a plane ✌ i ' m good .
__label__0 this is crazy , but i grabbed a few bottles myself . i won ’ t need to buy pain relievers for a while now even when the supply chain comes back . — — # latimes # panicbuy # coronavirus # supplychain # walmart # stockup
__label__0 actually coronavirus is already in your country because people thought it was a good idea to go on a cruise during this time . while i don ' t agree with bringing the wuhan expats back to sa , don ' t blame them and also why did government take so long ?
__label__0 soon atleast 1 person in all the states & amp ; us territories will be diagnosed with the coronavirus
__label__0 medicare for all wld do nothing 2 prevent spread of the coronavirus . you really think those ppl living on the street in ca are going 2 a clinic if they get sick ? we can ' t make them go to rehab for addiction or mental illness , so it aint happen ' for a virus .
__label__0 coronavirus in mexico during spring break ? someone quarantine us here
__label__0 can the coronavirus hit already ? i ' m really sick of leaving my house
__label__0 the great and powerful usa can ' t even diagnose # coronavirus . cdc test no good . netherlands has diagnostic test , no us officials over there asking how to do it . hospitals trying to develop own tests . trump admin is incompetent in a public health emergency .
__label__0 i ' m pregnant , living and working in sf , what are your best recommendations re preventing coronavirus ? should i wfh ? is swimming safe ? ( already stockpiling non - perishable foods . )
__label__0 the two hospitals china built in 10 days , i wouldn ’ t be surprised that they both have a morgue filled with thousands of dead bodies . # coronavirus
__label__0 have been online tutoring korean students in english recently & amp ; all have told me they ’ ve been staying home for weeks bc of coronavirus . when asked about food , they all got it delivered or sent nannies to shop . reminds me that staying home is a luxury only the wealthy can afford .
__label__0 actually people are buying the n 95 tight shell like masks that we use at the hospital . each health care giver needs to have the mask fit tested to be sure they are effective . 30 % of reported coronavirus patients in china were health care workers
__label__0 if coronavirus could spread her district would be a hotbed for it we should quarantine her from being in any elected office again forever
__label__0 new crag for me as one of the clients was worried about getting stuck in spain if the coronavirus outbreak gets worse so flew back today . as such we went to reconco and did a few of the route there . @ reconco de biar
__label__0 # coronavirus my friend is on a cruise right now .

__label__0 i think sad sick twitter caused coronavirus .
__label__0 really hoping coronavirus takes off in the us so i can score some cheap flights
__label__0 everyone cribbing about naming the school - cop on . my family ended up closing our school because of # h 1 n 1 we ( as a family ) didn ’ t feel stigmatized - we couldn ’ t anyway , we were in quarantine . i ’ d prefer people to know than not , so they can get tested and treated . # coronavirus
__label__0 omg the news on coronavirus is really pissing me off . 30 thousand tests and only 3 tested positive . stop spreading terror . you absolutely bag of wank ! ! !
__label__0 i ’ m just gonna go ahead and say it i will not be paying for a coronavirus test .
__label__1 a man is spinning coronavirus conspiracy theories on my plane right now . i ’ m going back to listening to # stupidlove on repeat .
__label__0 seriously , # msm ? ? my parents went to in simi , but couldn ' t even get parking , it was packed . they go to the wlv one , and completely out of # water . they said the coronavirus has people panicked . # fakenewsmedia # coronavirususa
__label__1 i ’ m still sick . . . and this coronavirus stuff is making me nervous . . . 🥺 🥺 my upper respiratory infection is now a lower respiratory infection per usual how my body handles getting sick . always in my lungs . always . . . .
__label__1 my school is shutdown due to coronavirus outbreak and since i recently travelled to fukuoka , i ’ ve been asked to be screened for # covid 19 this is solely precautionary and i am in good health , but the prospect of going around potentially sick people is somewhat concerning . . . . # korea
__label__0 we just recorded first positive case of coronavirus in nigeria on 28 / 2 / 2020 . could nigeria contain this covid - 19 and prevent it outbreaks just like that of ebola virus ? we hope to contain the virus . . i advise we maintain at least 2 . 1 meter distance from anyone presenting symptoms
__label__0 this coronavirus scare is lw dope . . start coughing and mf ’ s leave me alone
__label__0 hopin i get the coronavirus so i can get quarantined for a month . . . my month of rest and relaxation
__label__0 i have become hyper - aware of people coughing , sneezing and touching their face . went to a casino early this morning . i was miserable . all the touching . then i ordered a breakfast burrito . what was i thinking ? # coronavirus # covid 19
__label__0 # placesandspacesivebeen # mindtraveling # rememberthetime . . . . remember the time we flew from tokyo to phuket to bangkok and hung out in thailand ? . . . asia is off limits for now . . . thanks , coronavirus . 🤬 🤬 🤬 😆 😆 😆 @ bangkok , …
__label__0 i have a bad feeling about this . i think o ’ hare terminal 5 ( international flights ) already has the novel coronavirus . it just haven ’ t been reported yet .
__label__0 wow , my job is considering making us work from home until further notice due to coronavirus . i ’ m here for it . ima miss the homies though .
__label__0 apparently , we did not buy enough food for the pan ( ic ) demic since the stores are virtually empty . but we did buy an enormous amount of wine last year in solvang and rum in cuba so i think we win quarantine ? # coronavirus
__label__0 another . # doctor ✝ ️ . 😷 rip my condolences . # coronavirus
__label__0 trump ’ s coordinator for coronavirus is dr . debbie birx . debbie is a doctor , she ’ s been the us global aids / hiv coordinator since 2014 and she ’ s a retired army colonel .

__label__0 coronavirus is going to ruin my cruise . . . been waiting too long for this shit for it to be ruined by a damn virus
__label__0 oh my god ! we just got back from a trip to walmart and sam ' s . thanks to the impending coronavirus apocalypse , people are nuts ! they ' re rushing around throwing stuff in their carts while their children shreik . water . . . gone ( except arrowhead ) . peanut butter . . . almost gone .
__label__0 sad how one of the first thoughts about this whole coronavirus issue is that i definitely don ’ t have enough sick time to cover myself in the event of such a diagnosis .
__label__1 screening for coronavirus at the hospital tonight ! i love my job . i love my job . i love my job . . . 😬 😬 😬
__label__0 coronavirus has officially hit the area i live in . as if my anxiety wasn ’ t high enough . i feel sick .
__label__0 this guy just sat down next to me at the airport and he ’ s wearing a face mask and it has me really uncomfortable right now . would it be wrong of me to ask him if he had # coronavirus ? 👀
__label__0 so in the last 48 hours , my grandfather had a stroke ( he ’ s actually recovering well ) , my dad was hospitalized for a bad flu ( he ’ s home now , and no not coronavirus ) and a close family friend suddenly died from an ulcer . now there are confirmed covid cases near my parents . i ’ m done
__label__1 i have a question . i recently traveled over 9000 miles one way from nc to eventually the maldives . i got a slight sore throat , a little bit of a cough , and a stuffy nose . for 4 days , i ran a fever of 99 . 5 f , which is small . i ’ m fine now . did i have coronavirus ?
__label__0 i ’ m really bad at not touching my face / mouth . on the flip side i ’ m rarely sick since i hit my 30 s . . . so my immune system works . but sounds like coronavirus will make anyone sick regardless .
__label__0 i sneezed at the airport yesterday and some random white guy was like " that ' s how we ' re all gonna catch it " sir excuse me but say that one more time and the only thing you ' ll be catching is these hands # racism # coronavirus
__label__0 so coronavirus has hit my area . was only a matter of time . just a wait now to see how many people the gentleman has come into contact with already . soon be time for self quarantine in the mcleans . wonder if my boss will be so understanding when i tell him my plans 🤔 💙
__label__0 coronavirus in ny ? bet . i ’ m about to cough every single time i get on the train so i can get a seat .
__label__1 coronavirus just became real ! as we landed , a plane with hundreds of chinese in masks was with us through customs . very scary feeling
__label__1 back from the far east . unlike there , no screening / advice at lhr . work ( understandably ) want me to wfh for now ; busy nhs direct called me back at 2 am , say 14 day incubation but won ' t refer for test w / o symptoms & amp ; say no need to self - isolate . all a bit unsatisfactory # coronavirus
__label__0 guess what ? if we ' d have had proper screening at airports of passengers coming in from hotspots such as northern italy , we ' d probably have no cases . . health worker at cancer clinic is among 13 new coronavirus uk cases via
__label__0 coronavirus . my opinion is that officials are basing their decision on false premises . continental countries sound . but we are an island and could have been protected if they did not allow non australians into the country . yep our quarantine approach ok for aussies
__label__1 all these coughers on my train need to go & amp ; self isolate , coronavirus or not , i don ’ t want your germs 😷 🦠
__label__1 i landed in 4 different countries over the last 4 days . only one country took my temperature before they allowed me off the plane . it ’ s the only country out of the 4 with no coronavirus cases . 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️
__label__0 coronavirus live updates colleague at work just informed us a bus load of children returned from a school trip abroad and have been confirmed to have # coronavirus in # stevenage
__label__1 i have not been well and have been coughing for months . today i went to a medical centre across from my work in sydney as i now got a sore throat as well . the gp was so freaked out that i might have # coronavirus that i felt he did not check me properly .
__label__0 # jamaica did not let a # cruise at the island … good 4 them ! i wish # puertorico did the same thing to control the # selfishtourist from spreading the # coronavirus are you in such need of a # vacation that you ’ re willing to die for it ? # dominicanrepublic as declared their 1 st 😱 🤧 😷 🤒
__label__0 if we ' re being told to self isolate if we get coronavirus , should those of us on zero contracts or self employed be compensated by the government ?
__label__1 it ' s amazing tia . i just spent four days in the world renown cleveland clinic , tested for flu , being treated for pneumonia and associated a - fib , and not one word re coronavirus . and i ' m compromised with copd .
__label__1 i ’ ve got a bit of a cold . catarrh , coughing that kind of thing . if i had a pound for every person who ’ s mentioned coronavirus . . . well , i ’ d have a pound .
__label__0 coronavirus is the much needed cull our planet needs . . . # loosewomen
__label__0 okay my little town malmesbury may have coronavirus , i ’ m worried since i have a poor immune system , yet i hope the students self - isolating are okay and don ’ t have anything 💗 # coronavirusuk # coronavirus
__label__0 this cannot be good . i feel like crap my eyes are watery i keep sneezing and my nose is running . i must have that damn # coronavirus
__label__0 i remember working at a detainee center in iraq when we had one come in , coughing it up right in front of me . found out later that day he had full blown tb . i tested fine . bring it # coronavirus . of course this tweet will probably haunt me later . # ftw
__label__0 funny , would think coronavirus isn ' t a part of your portfolio . . . not the pence should have it either . but most insulting is jr ' s comments about how dems want millions killed just to make daddy look bad . y ' all just need to step down . i can ' t work with you ! ! !
__label__0 how can we not be alarmed when we can ' t even test for # coronavirus ? ? ? ? us is not prepared and had plenty of time . something needs to change and now ! ! ! ! are medical protected ? ? we should be setting up shelters etc .
__label__0 people taking about # coronavirus , i basically live in quarantine at home anyway , so cool .
__label__0 my flight for tampa is booked all my confirmation emails came in and then one confirmed case of coronavirus was reported in tampa . . . me all weekend
__label__0 we officially have coronavirus in oregon . just let me know when i can work from home chile . that ’ s all i wanna know .
__label__0 got torched at chili ’ s yesterday and booked a flight to la so i can get the coronavirus
__label__1 i have been saying this too . rampant flu like illness that everyone seems to have . i am never ill and now entering week 5 of it . every coronavirus symptom apart from kidney failure and pneumonia
__label__0 this was a series on about # coronavirus or # covid 19 . it is directed to kids but really is good for all of us . check out their post to see the complete series . did you know that we have a health clinic at 1165 …
__label__0 i work in a hospital emergency room on sundays , and i ’ m taking a cruise to mexico in less than 3 weeks . i wonder what my odds are of getting # coronavirus .
__label__0 home , sick 🤒 . but i ’ m not at all worried about # coronavirus because # trump has now put our in charge of this potential pandemic . he went to medical school , right ?
__label__1 i am sick as fuck and i have to fly tomorrow . fuck . people are going to think i have coronavirus . its just a cold
__label__0 # coronavirus hit # washingtonstate where we have mandatory sick leave . if you ' re sick stay home . also , burn the dead
__label__1 i have a sore throat and my body is aching , at what point does it become fathomable that i may have coronavirus ? ? ?
__label__0 checked the symptoms of coronavirus to see if i had caught it at paris fashion week . somewhat dispiriting to realize that the symptoms are the same as those for a hangover and slee deprivation . 😌
__label__0 how will public transportation be affected ? has the ministry / govt provided adequate protective gear for health care workers ? will the church tell their followers that coronavirus is the lord testing you ? will we quarantine an entire apartment block if 1 person is infected
__label__0 wait if we have to stay home for coronavirus does that mean grindr would be . . . a bad idea ? or a great way to meet neighbors in a difficult time ?
__label__0 i believe the coronavirus was created & amp ; released . it ’ s easier for the government to kill us off by sickness .
__label__0 fear misinformation & amp ; rumour are the biggest challenges that need to be overcome to address # coronavirus we must not panic , but wash our hands regularly , stop shaking hands , sneeze / cough into tissues & amp ; dispose of them , stay home if sick & amp ; if we go out when sick , wear a mask !
__label__0 just found out the physicist , who i feel uncomfortable with is the only physristic in my town who is able to give me a gender dysphoria diagnosis as well constant scare of people telling me about how i am going to die of the coronavirus .
__label__0 at least the only good thing is , if i get the coronavirus and end up needing to isolate myself . . . . hopefully it ’ ll be after animal crossing comes out ! 😅 🙈
__label__0 maws came home to me still in bed n has convinced hersel a have coronavirus , 1 can only hope marie x
__label__1 coronavirus in florida starts trending the second we sit down in the airplane back home
__label__0 i ’ m scared to cough because of # coronavirus but i swear it ’ s because of the wind and allergies 😭
__label__0 i got the perfect payback . cough / spit on the muh fucker and tell him he just got coronavirus
__label__0 sooooooooooooooo are we stopping flights yet , ? ? ? hello ? anyone there ? # coronaoutbreak # coronavirus # cdnpoli # toronto # covid 19 canada
__label__0 i guess one way for the coronavirus to get to zero is not to test anybody
__label__0 you mean to tell me someone with coronavirus was at north star mall ? ? ? the mall i stay visiting ? ? ? and the san antonio airport ? ? ? should i write my will ?
__label__0 went to my local walgreens to pick up some more hand sanitizer because i was running low — nope ! they ’ re sold out ! ! # coronavirus # flu
__label__1 my sister is home sick and every time she coughs my grammy says “ go over there coronavirus ” 😂 😂 😂

__label__0 😃 . . . they don ' t think that if only one of them had tested positive for coronavirus , whether he knew it or not , the others would have all been infected , in the heat , my love . so many times , people act disproportionately . 😘 ❤ ℐℓ ٥ ﻻ ﻉ √ ٥ υ ❤ 😍 💓 💕 💎 💍 🎸 🎶 🌹 🌹 🌹
__label__0 the current flu has infected and killed more people than the coronavirus i have never shook anyone ' s hands i don ' t want to get sick ever from anything the best way to make a sign of peace is to say peace be with you and bow
__label__0 this is true bc no one got this way during mers & amp ; sars , which are both a corona virus that mutated differently ppl didn ' t even act this way about polio b 4 measles vaccine , i remember individual homes being quarantined 2 help prevent spread but that ' s it
__label__0 coronavirus 6 weeks in us and we only have 445 test kits 4 4 5 test kits usa has 445 test kits south korea has tested close to 67 , 000 people while usa has 4 4 5 test kits in 6 weeks
__label__0 i ’ m at the airport and i see coronavirus everywhere .
__label__0 my company just had a meeting and bc of coronavirus , we can all work from home if we want not cool bc of the virus but 😍 😍 😍
__label__1 hi leslie , i did not get tested for the new coronavirus . this is the bill for quarantine and testing of flu and other types of coronavirus . when doctors found me positive for the flu , they released me immediately .
__label__0 thank you 🙌 🏼 💚 i hope we can also set - up clinical trials on promising antiviral medications , which could be helpful for a growing number of critically ill # covid 19 patients in iran . # globalhealth # coronaoutbreak # coronavirus
__label__0 mr . president , the democrats are a bigger sickness for our country than coronavirus ever will be
__label__0 all this coronavirus news is making my anxiety go overboard and giving me constant headaches . i keep having friends asking me about it and they can ' t comprehend the science behind it and constantly say that they don ' t want to die . . . it ' s just too much lol . .
__label__0 in other words , “ due to the current gag order handed down by the # trump administration , we will not talk about how bad the # coronavirus situation is here . or that testing is not being done . no test , no epidemic , right ? ” # covid 19 # covid 19 usa # cdcgagorder # covidtesting # maga # kag ? !
__label__0 people , if you fear having coronavirus . . . please visit the website on what to do . stop bombarding your local laboratories and doctors offices with calls , we do not do coronavirus testing .
__label__0 went to lick my ballot closed and my subconscious screamed coronavirus at me . thanks i hate it .
__label__0 the # cdc is not telling us the truth because the # trump administration is telling them to be quiet about the truth of # covid 19 / # coronavirus . they are not testing people . no test / no epidemic . even so , # usa is now in the top 5 for new deaths today , with a 6 % death rate . flu = 0 . 1 % .
__label__0 # jewishexcellence the first antiviral drug arose from her research . we ' re going to need another jew to step up to the plate and tackle the coronavirus threat . my throat hurts . lol .
__label__0 on a packed luas from the 3 arena and someone just said “ nobody cough we ’ ll get coronavirus ”
__label__0 i don ’ t trust a word mike pence says about anything with the coronavirus ! ! ! ! hes not a doctor and knows less . i trust my garage man for coronavirus updates over mike pence 🦠 🤮
__label__0 my mom works in a hospital and is terrified of the coronavirus so she ’ s going shopping to stock up our house just incase shit goes south
__label__0 hearing from about how to prevent # coronavirus in our lives . we should 1 . wash our hands often . ✅ 2 . stay home when you ’ re experiencing flu - like symptoms . ✅ 3 . keep distance from others who may be sick . ✅
__label__0 i wish i had a job right now so i could call in sick today because of the coronavirus
__label__0 # coronaoutbreak # coronavirus they sent out a mass email listing a bunch of symptoms and then saying “ if you feel any of these symptoms together , please see your doctor and stay home ” . i was like . . . .
__label__0 so my new # work schedule since we are trying to finish up regression testing is now 5 am to 6 pm until further notice . i ’ ll need the money since we might not get back the plane ✈ ️ ticket money for # japan 🙁 # mondaymotivation # mondaythoughts # coronavirus
__label__0 i ’ m coughing a lot but i don ’ t know how to say , “ i don ’ t have coronavirus i ’ m just a pothead . “
__label__0 all he does is deflect , blame , label and then lie . it doesn ' t matter what it is , he will act like a spoiled child when he doesn ' t get his way ! i personally am sick and tired of him and all his lies . blaming the dems for coronavirus is beyond stupid even for him . . . . .
__label__0 ok , i have a question why are people stocking up on bottled water in case of a # coronavirus outbreak ? will our water systems stop piping water into our house in the event we get sick ?
__label__0 so while president alfred e . neuman is saying “ what , me worry ? go buy stocks ! ” about the coronavirus , the cdc website basically has fucking nothing useful to say other than “ wash your hands ” and “ cough into a kleenex ” and “ hey , we ’ re hiring ! ” 🙄
__label__1 my bf is convinced he has the coronavirus because he got ‘ sick ’ when we came back from seattle 🤦 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ 🙄 why are men so dramatic
__label__0 i just looked up the symptoms of the coronavirus and uh . . . . . . . .
__label__0 curious as to why they thought he possibly had # coronavirus ? is anyone exhibiting a cough now suspect ? that makes me more nervous than the virus .

__label__1 oh dear lord . one of my friends just told me she ’ s been sick with all the # coronavirus symptoms but hasn ’ t gone to the doctor because she doesn ’ t want the factory she works at to have to shut down . we are all going to die .
__label__0 today we went to the park for some sports , with masks and hand gloves . the coronavirus is still big threat . school holidays are extended to no date . many companies asked their people to work at home . quarantine is still enforced . good news is the infected number is going down .
__label__0 maybe if the government covered all doctor ' s visits associated with suspected # coronavirus symptoms , more people would get tested . i ' m not paying $ 150 to go to the doctor to be told i have a mild virus with no cure .

__label__0 it is incumbent upon us to have an emergent diagnostic / treatment plan for our homeless and border detainees re the coronavirus which affects every human . to reject these populations is foolish and unwise — and extremely risky .
__label__0 two cases of coronavirus in georgia . all i can say is , wash your hands people and get prepared ! i plan to talk to my employer today about our preparedness plan if we all have to work from home .
__label__0 there are minimal cases of coronavirus in the us because they only test you if you have been out of the country or in contact w someone who has been tested . w t f
__label__0 so , if you think you have coronavirus , but it ' s not at a point where a test would confirm it , what are you supposed to do , really ? i ' m talking about like , how do you treat it at home ? fluids , sleep , ibuprofen , like a normal cold / flu ? ( i ' m fine , btw . )

__label__0 today we went to the park for some sports , with masks and hand gloves . the coronavirus is still big threat . school holidays are extended to no date . many companies asked their people to work at home . quarantine is still enforced . good news is the infected number is going down .
__label__0 one of his underlings knowingly flew a number of people infected with a highly contagious virus to the us on a plane that was full of uninfected people . the person he put in charge of not turning this into a pandemic thinks praying the ga . . . coronavirus away will actually help . . .
__label__0 our government has just been letting the coronavirus spread through our country going “ undetected ” for weeks , giving the disease time to infect more people then they are telling the public . our healthcare system wants us to get sick for population control & amp ; money
__label__0 the hospital my dad works at is where one of the first german coronavirus cases ( a doctor and his daughter ) was documented and treated . and of course , i had to read about this on the news rather than my dad thinking this might be worth telling me .
__label__0 for those who don ' t know , i live in central washington state , about 90 miles from seattle , where i am a pediatric hospitalist . concerns about covid - 19 are reaching fever pitch . as a thought expriment , i ' m going to tweet all of the questions i get asked today about # coronavirus .
__label__0 coronavirus better not fuck with my flight to mexico i know that !
__label__0 louder for the people in the back 👏 🏻 👏 🏻 👏 🏻 “ masks are not effective in preventing general public from catching # coronavirus , but if healthcare providers can ’ t get them to care for sick patients , it puts them and our communities at risk ” 🥺 🥺 🥺
__label__0 my partner works as a nurse practitioner in a hospital ( in washington state , 60 miles south of seattle ) and the cdc is not providing testing for coronavirus , even as the hospital frequently requests it .
__label__0 this coronavirus getting so out of hand . . . . i ’ m keeping my son quarantined until it ’ s over 🤯
__label__0 if any of you nasty mother fuckers give an innocent girl scout coronavirus while shes learning to a strong business woman by selling cookies , all because you chose not to stay home if you ' re sick , i ' m gonna be pissed .
__label__0 i have seasonal allergies . every spring i get cold / flu like symptoms because of my allergies even with meds because they ’ re so severe . i already have a hard time differentiating between allergies and a virus . i ’ m afraid that i will get # coronavirus and not be aware i ’ m sick .
__label__1 the girl that served me my drink at starbucks seemed sick in the drive thru window . she was sniffling with a runny nose . you guys should send even mildly sick employees home right now . had to throw my drink away # coronavirus

__label__0 nobody with a lesser ailment ( read a pre - existing condition ) dares go into a hospital in my county now . coronavirus everywhere ! jay inslee has testified publicly that he is inept and unable to work with pence . pence will bring solutions anyways . my city has banned iding people .
__label__1 i told jen i have a massive headache so she asked me if i ’ ve been to china or have the coronavirus 🙃
__label__1 everytime i cough in public i can see people eyeballing me moving away from me and obviously thinking ‘ omg she ’ s got the coronavirus ’ 🙄

__label__0 omg i ’ m sick of coronavirus edwina currie thought we were all gonna die through salmonella through dodge eggs my understanding is it ’ s all down to the super power america hey are trying to follow on from where hitler left off it ’ s a man made virus just like aids
__label__0 nothing about homelessness 🤔 🤔 the coronavirus is real and also deadly . homelessness is real and deadly as well . with the two conbined it will be a disaster to the homeless to not be able to have shelter , if it helps decrease our chances of getting in contact with the disease .
__label__1 the same people freaking out over coronavirus are also coughing in my face & amp ; wiping their snotty noses without washing their hands 🤦 🏼 ‍ ♀ ️

__label__1 the six week " cold " i had that started after i came back from san diego had a lot of the symptoms of coronavirus . felt a lot like bronchitis . i ' ve thought about this as well . doctors only asked if i had been to china when i went in to get it checked out .
__label__0 i don ’ t think many are overhyped of the dangers . the weakness = complacency of america was figured out by a state , by a group , by a virus . america is not ready . how are other countries testing so many . test for coronavirus in general ! ! ! then secondary test for covid 19 .
__label__0 people should not have to pay for # coronavirus tests ! ! this is why we need # bernieforpresident !
__label__0 * staying inside because i can ' t afford to go anywhere and if i get coronavirus i can ' t go to the hospital because my health insurance options cost 10 % of my paycheck to get basically no coverage * freeeeeeedooooooom wooooooooooo ! * slams a natural light *
__label__1 on my international trips in recent weeks many folks were coughing and masks would have eased my anxiety about getting sick . travelers and those experiencing respiratory illness should have access to masks too . # coronavirus # sarscov 19
__label__0 sooner or later if the coronavirus keeps spreading across the us everybody is going to have to go for testing just to make sure it gets stopped other wise people are going to just keep spreading it . if i had a reason i thought i had to go to the hospital i would think twice
__label__0 i really hope this coronavirus jawn keeps up so i can snag a cheap flight with my tax return
__label__0 thanks sam . it ’ s great to bring some prospective to the situation regarding coronavirus . tb appears these days not to be reported but certainly a few years ago it was very difficult to cure . i remember the hospital sunshine wards with the balcony to wheel patients out in the sun .
__label__0 # coronavirus # covid 19 # sars _ cov _ 2 165 total infected in spain 7 on icu , 5 critical 1 st death registered 13 february . a test now revealed that he had the virus , died of pneumonia . a man who traveled to nepal , " not young " . i wonder how many were infected by him . hcws , family etc
__label__0 today as a challenge to myself , i travelled from my office in canary wharf along the jubilee line , changed at baker street for a meeting at great portland street - and back again , al without touching a surface , handle , door etc etc i wanted to just see if it was poss # coronavirus
__label__0 don ' t want to be too silly about this because it is serious & amp ; i applaud them for it but wouldn ' t offering free # coronavirus test be socialism ?
__label__1 yup , this is how it is at my hospital in seattle also . unless you ' re showing severe symptoms , like a persistent pneumonia etc , you will not be admitted and you will not be tested . and you certainly will not be tested unless you are admitted first . # coronavirusseattle # coronavirus
__label__0 just got an email from our ceo / owner on the coronavirus telling us that we need to stay home if we ' re sick . well buddy that would certainly be easier if our fucking sick time didn ' t come out of our pto
__label__0 i hope the # coronavirus pandemic is remembered as the time when millions of managers suddenly realized that all this employee travel is completely unnecessary and wasteful and bad for the environment and we can let our staff work from home — and work still gets done 🤷 ‍ ♂ ️ # covid _ 19
__label__0 posting this for who got banned for a “ tongue punch her fart box ” comment . lame . you going to tell me doctors can do this , but can ’ t cure coronavirus ?
__label__0 i ’ m going to come straight out and say this i ’ m not buying into the # coronavirus hysteria . i ’ m fit and healthy . i seldom , if ever , get sick . if i do , well , i can ’ t change the direction the wind blows . in other # news i have enough toilet roll to wipe my ass for 6 months . # theend
__label__0 extreme social distancing is imposed in the us , too , but it has nothing to do with coronavirus .
__label__0 i was going to recommend to avoid businesses that don ’ t offer paid sick leave but then i remembered we live in the united states so nvm lol # coronavirus
__label__0 finally getting the customers in here asking if any of us are sick or are feeling the “ effects of coronavirus . . ” is it because i work in a ramen place . . . ? ? ? ? ? 🍜
__label__1 now , i cannot cough out in public without being judged . jesus . keep safe y ’ all . # covid 19 nz # coronavirus

__label__0 had a meeting today about the # coronavirus , and the good news is that if i get it , i get to work from home . 🙌 🏽
__label__0 schools need to close down in the united states until this coronavirus clears . “ 100 ” cases in just a few days . . . 😐 these numbers about to go up ! children do not have the best hygiene habits . why we waiting until it pops up in the communities . we should all go into quarantine ! 🦠
__label__0 crazy idea here . . . maybe i should go get # coronavirus on purpose now while there ’ s lots of hospital beds so i ’ m immune later when everything gets crazy
__label__0 can i borrow the coronavirus for a year so i can be quarantined from my bills ? asking for a friend .

__label__0 look . if i sneeze , or cough , and you even mention coronavirus , i reserve all rights to wipe my kleenex on you , kick you in the shin , and cough on you . because i ’ m getting over a headcold . not coronavirus . # gohomekaren
__label__0 dom came home and said , seriously , “ i think i have coronavirus ”
__label__0 just got off my shift at the hospital tonight and had to stop for gas . realized the gas pump handle is a huge potential contamination . it ’ s shiny metal . the coronavirus cans live in that type surface for a long time .

__label__0 im so sick of hearing about the coronavirus and the over sensationalized media around it . wash your hands . dont be nasty . thats all you need to do . people are getting real stupid and its time to stop freaking out
__label__0 all my friends have already grown weary of me droning on about this election . t ’ s fortunate for them that the coronavirus has inspired me to quarantine myself from their booger eating children .
__label__0 are you reconsidering # travel plans due to the coronavirus ? we leave for orlando in a few weeks and are still going . however , our trip to spain and italy this summer is in question . we ' re not booking flights for now , until we see what happens . what about you ?
__label__1 2 . 5 hours later i get an apologetic callback . the follow - up and pleading necessary to talk to a doctor when i have sudden flu symptoms while living in the heart of the u . s . coronavirus outbreak is not a good look .

__label__1 wow check this out i live in st louis mo i was born in the usa . i was told when i asked where i could be tested for the coronavirus and heres the response i received . wow needless to say i ' ve never been tested and i never will be because american citizens dont have any test kits !

__label__0 everybody can get a coronavirus test if our drug companies don ' t try to rape us on the price ! moscow mitch would not support the bill the house passed and he refused to bring it forward . cost for tests must be reasonable . mcconnell does not want americans to afford the tests . 💩

__label__0 oh there was a confirmed case of coronavirus at the shops we went to right before i got sick . . * nervously laughs * it was just something i ate made me unwell but how scary to think about .

__label__1 i lowkey thought i had the coronavirus last night . i had 4 / 7 symptoms
__label__0 with # coronavirus making handshakes moot , and as we are all coughing into our hands and sleeves , i am insisting my department replace " fist bump " and " elbow bump " greetings with the tried and true " click and wink finger gun . " one for strangers ; two if co - worker .

__label__0 is a non factor in the # coronavirus health crisis ! he & amp ; his administration have proven how incompetent & amp ; partisan they are ! we must tune trump , & amp ; out as they are unqualified & amp ; pathetic in dealing with crisis ! we need to listen to the doctors & amp ; scientists

__label__1 i know it ’ s ridiculous , but i ’ m a bit grumpy that i ’ ve ended up with a nasty case of human metapneumovirus rather than coronavirus , because it feels like people are judging me for staying home sick when if it had been coronavirus they would have been thrilled i stayed away .
__label__0 nationwide in the us in 2018 , 31 , 000 , 000 got sick with the flu and 65 , 000 died , and we were fine ! if we continue to panic and have the media predict the end of the world this way , even with numbers hitting that high worldwide , it will be pandemonium ! # coronavirus # coronapanic

__label__0 the lack of universal healthcare & amp ; sick pay makes us more vulnerable to the spread of # coronavirus & amp ; future epidemics . if a person has no healthcare , can ’ t afford a dr visit & amp ; goes to work when sick because they can ’ t afford to miss that pay , that increases the risk to all .
__label__0 👧 🏻 you adults need to step up your $ snap game it ’ s red when everything is green ! 🧔 🏻 research $ fb ipo . last week i dropped your $ aapl cost by $ 31 👧 🏻 how ? 🧔 🏻 how low did the facebook ipo go ? 👧 🏻 so if we catch # coronavirus on april vaca , we get quarantine for 2 - weeks ! 🧔 🏻 😂 no

__label__0 so let me get this straight — did our # moroninchief say that he didn ’ t want to bring americans , who were infected with # coronavirus on the cruise ship , back to the us because it would harm the statistics ? not because they might pass the virus on to more ? ( also a bad reason )
__label__0 alright this # coronavirus need to chill the fuck out ! i have flight to jamaica coming up soon ! 🖕 🏼
__label__0 the good news is that if we are under quarantine in a few weeks and the internet goes down , i own all of buffy , angel , and firefly on blu - ray so we ’ ll be okay . # coronavirus # pandemic
__label__0 went to a bar and i said i ’ d take a corona . . . people scattered , guess they must have assumed corona virus . # coronavirus

__label__1 i gave myself plenty of time to get to lax tonight so naturally it took 30 minutes to uber here from # nela and no time to get through security since the airport is a # coronavirus ghost town so i think my flight is ten hours from now .

__label__0 saw a tweet that flight prices are down because of the coronavirus and sure enough , i check the flight dates for my trip home next month and it ’ s $ 100 less than what i booked it for . 😫
__label__0 the trouble is that the vast majority of people with flu like symptoms are not being tested for coronavirus because authorities in europe and us want to quell anxiety about it . however , every death is recorded , so that inflates the death rate ; which increases anxiety anyway .
__label__0 the risk of covid - 19 transmission on an airplane is low , that ’ s “ something we ’ re anxious to get across , ” says david powell # coronavirus # covid ー 19 # airlines

__label__1 wish i could shake this post - infection feeling . exhausted and achy . stomach ache . not enough to bother my gp or the hospital . it ’ s not coronavirus either but i ’ m pretty much fed up now
__label__0 # coronavirus # lasvegas it just a matter of time . surprised took so long . i ' m keeping my husband home out of an abundance of caution . he ' s 69 w / heart cond & amp ; works w / the conventions . since there ' s no real monitoring at airport not chancing it . am i being silly ? what would u do ?
__label__0 now that he ' s unleashed all the infected members of his base and given them a false sense of safety , i guess i ' ll have to self quarantine and wait out the coronavirus . i don ' t want them sneezing or coughing anywhere in my vicinity !
__label__0 with all this panic buying people and animals are gonna suffer with food shortages . . . so we went to the cat n dug home and saved 8 cats n 12 dugs . . . now we can literally breed our own burgers . ahm a problem solver . . thats why they pay me the big bucks . . 🐕 🐈 🍔 🍟 # coronavirus
__label__0 i remember how sick the swine flu shot made me . i just sit over here and watch to see how the rest of you do . # coronavirus
__label__0 two coronavirus cases at our hospital 👀
__label__1 our teacher went to italy last week and guess what ? ofc she was supposed to stay in quarantine but she normally came to school like nothing happened and she was teaching us till tuesday . . and school can not give us no informations about her ! if she has the coronavirus . . 💀
__label__0 some thoughts on # coronavirus . . . in my 14 years of working in retail , i ’ ve only called in sick probably less than 10 times . all the companies i ’ ve worked for have had terrible sick day policies and i have never made enough to afford to miss even a day of work .
__label__0 mad victim blaming here . i asked ‘ someone ’ about travel to a place as coronavirus - safe as dublin . he said , “ it ’ s probably fine but you ’ d never forgive yourself if you travelled and got it ” . i said , “ what if i stay and get it in dublin ? he said “ well that wouldn ’ t be as bad ” 🤯
__label__1 tbh , this worldwide coronavirus pandemic is scary as shit . one of my throat glands r sore , struck me 2 days ago . but other than that & amp ; my usual allergies , im perfectly fine & amp ; feel totally well , and i haven ' t traveled outside the country for well over a year . should i get tested ?
__label__1 i was in a flight from la to houston wearing a mask . some fat bastard looked at me , looked around and told his friends , ” be careful , there ’ s a few of them on this flight ” . get the fuck out of here with your xenophobia . # coronavirus # xenophobia

__label__0 few months ago i had a dream , it was bad , people were sick , really sick , i don ’ t mean to alarm you , but yea it ’ s gonna get real bad this coronavirus here in sa , joke now !
__label__1 even now that they admit that they think i do have it they can ' t , won ' t , or are unwilling to even send out my swabbed samples to test em to confirm or deny if i have the coronavirus because i ' m not a " high risk patient " they still wouldn ' t test me . . .
__label__0 so i had to make a coronavirus quarantine travel policy poster at work today so that ’ s good
__label__0 so why am i not yet packed for my 600 am flight leaving tomorrow ? # coronavirus
__label__0 who says the death rate of # coronavirus is 3 . 4 % . president trump says the global rate is around 1 % . but the us coronavirus death rate is almost 10 % ! clearly we ’ re not testing and are hiding numbers . death isn ’ t as easy to hide , and it shows . or the us got the super xxl strain ?
__label__0 i keep sneezing so i either have seasonal allergies or coronavirus
__label__0 re ready and willing not to touch each other anymore since the # coronavirus is here in sa , ngoku lere re bereka jwang ka taba ya chelete ? aker who says you can get the virus by touching a substance that is contaminated with the virus , we cough and touch money daily ngoku lareng ?
__label__1 now that i nearly lost my job , because of a case of coronavirus amongst the employees , i planed to do a lot of things , such as recreating recipes , but i ' m scared to set the apartment building on fire . . .
__label__0 man i hope the coronavirus kills the handshake . im so sick of people touching me
__label__0 did the president say we didn ' t have hospitals ? do you think everyone in a hospital must be there because of the coronavirus ? i ' m trying to follow your logic here , and failing .
__label__1 worked from home for 2 weeks due to # coronavirus after feeling sick coming back from berlin . looking forward to seeing my # zencargo office again . will pick up a flu shot to train my immune system further , advice from my smart scientist wife # remotework = competitive advantage .
__label__0 one additional comment . no cases in patients in our hospital after extensive surveillance so the hcws have most likely acquired in the community . carnival was probably the perfect storm . # coronavirus
__label__0 the coronavirus gonna ruin my cruise in 2 weeks ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
__label__0 # coronavirus drags down passengers told not to travel to the airport . i went to find out more .
__label__0 how tf do people with coronavirus be traveling so much ? ? ? one time i got a minor headache and i skipped all my classes for the day .
__label__1 this pilot who ended up sitting next to us on our flight said he ’ s more scared of going to mexico than getting coronavirus . sir , shut the fuck up with your nasty ass racism .
__label__0 yo , as a kid i ate boogers , dirt , and bugs and as an adult i eat ass . i been legit sick like maybe 10 days since i was 10 . i ' m 35 now . i ' m not scared about # coronavirus .
__label__0 so the hospital in kettering where supposedly shook hands with coronavirus patients hands is the same hospital where my sister just gave birth to her third child . this amount of misinformation is terribly worrying & amp ; has caused for an unprecedented amount of fear .
__label__0 i am sick of hearing about coronavirus , hand sanitizer shortages and lidls running out of pasta
__label__0 cmo of q 3 2019 “ we can ’ t get these idiots to wash their hands or even sanitize themselves . we put dispensers at airports , costco ’ s , malls , grocery stores . what will it take ! ? ” intern “ prob like a pandemic or something ” cmo “ get china on the phone ” # coronavirus
__label__0 if the worst impact coronavirus has on my social life is “ prevents me from being able to perform in an improv showcase tonight bc i got quarantined , ” i ’ ll be really lucky . y ’ all i don ’ t wanna be a vector of diseases but i ’ m buuuummmed , will perform dumb improv games over skype .

__label__1 i ’ m pretty sure we have no idea how many cases are in hawaii now ( with tons of east asian tourists ) , but people act like not knowing means zero . instead i think this coughing epidemic which has taken half the kids out of my son ’ s class could well be coronavirus .
__label__0 my small town walmart was out of hand sanitizer this morning , target as well . the hoarders win . no masks , no sanitizer left . i went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of wine instead . cheers . 🥂 # myeloma # cancer # coronavirus

__label__0 my parents traveled over 20 hours across the globe in the last two days , heard my voice on the phone and quickly asked if i have " that coronavirus . " i don ' t , and i ' m sick of being sick , but on the flip side , it feels good to have them back on the same continent as me .
__label__0 stop buying n 95 respirator masks if you haven ’ t been fitted properly for them they don ’ t even work and now my hospital is on a shortage for them and i ’ m actually taking care of y ’ all grandmas ! ! ! ! ! ! i don ’ t want to spread the coronavirus to them bc we don ’ t have any dam masks ! !

__label__0 a 9 depending on which doctors i spoke with , messaging was mixed ! they were trying to get info themselves . the ones who were most honest seemed 2 b most thorough usually the case . best advice take it seriously , but don ' t panic . # coronavirus # chronic

__label__0 i ’ m so glad my healthcare job is gonna let me work from home during this coronavirus outbreak 🙏
__label__0 i ’ m not sure 100 % . there had been talk of coronavirus possibly spreading through pipes , but i assume that ’ s unproven ( ? ) . if there would be a mass quarantine , is it possible pswa workers would stay home too ? purification could stop ? i don ’ t know .
__label__0 sir , before coronavirus does anything , people in my colony might fall sick due to this first 🙄
__label__0 everyone right now in the us about people coming back from the hot zones # covid - 19 # montgomerycounty # coronavirus

__label__0 in times of coronavirus crisis when a simple 100 rs mask is being sold for rs 600 and sanitizer for rs 999 plz do remember that not a single doctor has raised his / her fees despite risking their lives and their staff ' s lives . for doctors our patients still need a healing touch .

__label__1 so i have a cold , right ? anyway i don ’ t get sick often so when i do it hits me hard . i was kinda better when i get to work . now mind you i am asian and one of my coworkers ask if i have the coronavirus ? like no i have a cold cause i never wear jackets to work when it ’ s cold out
__label__0 wow . the statement from this nurse in northern california who got sick after caring for a coronavirus patient “ what a ridiculous and uneducated response from the department that is in charge of the health of our country . ” why is there not more testing ?

__label__1 i just realized that i am very wicked last night i was coughing and sneezing . . . i actually thought i had coronavirus . i was scared but my wicked sef was thinking of who to infect 😃 😅 # coronaviruschallenge # covid ー 19
__label__0 unfortunately the # coronavirus is now officially in cardiff ! a chemist shop has already run of hand sanitiser and a doctor ’ s surgery in lockdown ! my advice to you doctor is to get in the tardis and get the heck out ! # mattsmith # doctorwho # cardiff
__label__0 chances are , you might have been with someone who was in the same plane with the person who is diagnosed with coronavirus . we meet people but we dont ask them of they travelled out the country recently
__label__0 # coronavirus gives me chills
__label__0 given that # coronavirus affects mainly older pts and pts with chronic illnesses why can my gp practice still not allow me to have access to my full medical notes given the lack of integration between nhs areas # chronicillness # asthma
__label__0 it ’ s not the coronavirus about knocking me sick . it ’ s the idiotic knee jerk reaction of every tom , dick and harry saying things like this . “ well done , people are to afraid to say it if it sounds racist . ” if that ’ s the reaction then it probably is , veneer or not
__label__0 it ’ s not the coronavirus im worried about knocking me sick . it ’ s the idiotic knee jerk reaction of every tom , dick and harry saying things like this . “ well done , people are too afraid to say it if it sounds racist . ” if that ’ s the reaction then it probably is , veneer or not

__label__0 we all now realize that the trump administration has been lying to all of us about the coronavirus there is not enough testing & amp ; it ' s not going to blow away like a fart in the wind it is spreading wildly among are elderly & amp ; sick many people could be carrying the virus everywhere
__label__0 the director of the # who . we need # testingkits now ! # trump / # maga / # kag promised us 1 m kits . doctors don ’ t have them . they cannot test . we are on the verge of mass community spread here in # nyc . nyc physicians are telling the truth & amp ; it ’ s not pretty . # testvirusnow # coronavirus 👆 🏼
__label__0 in the us even sick nurses can ’ t get a # covid 19 test 🤷 🏼 ‍ ♂ ️ # coronavirus
__label__0 i still don ' t think that people in the us understand the coronavirus situation & amp ; why the government is not testing & amp ; not screening . the virus is already here . everybody knows it . community spread is already happening . people now need to practice social distancing on their own .
__label__0 fear overtakes us when we choose to allow it to do so . . we have faulty risk perception . part of being # resilient is to control what we can not what we wish we could . wash your hands , stay home if you ’ re sick , eat healthy , & amp ; carry on with life . # coronavirus # covid ー 19 # mindfulness

__label__0 hospitals are the worst place to be right now with everything that ’ s going on with the coronavirus . yet here i am , walking into the hospital only because i ’ m a really good friend .
__label__0 i like how louisiana has only tested 4 people for coronavirus . feels great and i ' m definitely not worried for my immunocompromised friends
__label__0 hahaha ugh ! no not corona . mine came from exhaustion , weather , stress . . i went to the dr , i ’ m good , no coronavirus 😂
__label__0 so i went to north star mall today . . . . guess i ’ m bringing the coronavirus to hondo ✌ ️ ✌ ️
__label__0 i have not been tested but have put myself in self quarantine i ’ m young and healthy my body will heal itself i wonder if we can be immune from coronavirus after getting it or if we ’ ve able to get sick from other strains i rather be sick now than later when it ’ s madness
__label__1 we went to san francisco the last week of the year . my dad had a cough for a few weeks after . he told me today he thinks he may have had coronavirus . . .
__label__0 how are we going to quarantine everyone who soon be infected with # coronavirus ? can someone explain to me if all these folks are quarantined , how is this spreading ? who enforced a quarantine ? i mean if i run out of food , is someone bringing food ?
__label__0 was excited to go to church tomorrow , but then i remember there is a part in the service where the minister wants you to greet everyone with a hug or a handshake . . . . yeah i am staying home . getting my fix with joel osteen instead , as usual 🙏 🏿 # coronavirus
__label__0 everyone talking about cheap flights because of coronavirus makes me realize how much of a spoiled brat i am because i ’ ve never paid for an airplane ticket in my entire life 💚
__label__0 i read you ’ re supposed to cough into an elbow in case you might have coronavirus but they didn ’ t say whose elbow and now the guy next to me wants to fight .
__label__0 had to check on you . they say that lil coronavirus in the city now . crazy how many people getting sick . reminds me how sick i was when i lost you . damn your love was contagious . i ’ m here forever if you need me .
__label__1 so i flew back monday night . i was sick sunday night even sicker monday went to the urgent care tuesday . not one person called until late yesterday to tell me i just have a flu ( not coronavirus ) or to make sure i was quarantined until tests came back . & amp ; this is why ppl are dying
__label__1 i was checked . it ’ s not , between everything going on , bills mom passing , right after bill hurts himself , then the tooth . i ’ m tired , and the weather . just a viral infection i guess . fevers & amp ; cough that ’ s it . i promise , i ’ m ok no coronavirus
__label__0 shoutout to the coronavirus . im booking flights like a muhhfugga 😭
__label__0 fuck the # coronavirus i got baby fever 👉 🏻 👈 🏻
__label__0 forget january 1 st 2021 , the coronavirus means the uk would be better leaving the eu freedom of movement program today and then demand airlines do not allow boarding of people with symptoms and we should demand medical checks for those applying for uk entry .
__label__0 fuck coronavirus , me and my homies got bieber fever
__label__1 me after hearing someone cough on my $ 8 round trip flight to # italy # coronavirus # cabincrew # covid ー 19
__label__1 has updated us that there is no update yet on the 6 hr test for # coronavirus but we will be staying another night on the ship ! # carnivalpanorama
__label__0 the first case of the coronavirus in fresno has been confirmed ! no wonder costco was sold out of water when my grandpa & amp ; i went to buy some the other day . man this shit ’ s getting way too out of control smh 😳 🤦 ‍ ♂ ️
__label__0 i saw some staff cleaning up airport buses at kipling station . i appreciate them to take a risk . i hope no more # coronavirus # covid 19 spread in # toronto . thank you # ttc . i ’ m wondering how strict # yyz # pearsonairport .
__label__0 i would be upset that is misrepresenting the safety of missourians . why kc has only 5 coronavirus test kits and why vp mike pence ’ s remarks aren ’ t helpful .
__label__1 i ’ ve been isolating since i saw my doctor . she said go the hospital if it gets worse . i can ’ t tell if it has . there are so few tests . should i ask to have one , given my low risk ? # covid 19 # coronavirus # nyc # stateofemergency
__label__1 literally just got on flight 100 and found that my seat area was not cleaned . a used tissue / napkin in cup holder , another one in seat pocket . very concerned with coronavirus issues . i will be cringing my overnight flight . not comfortable .
__label__0 seattle still held a lingerie fashion show tonight that i was supposed to be in , because they wanted it to lead to dragging me away and locking me up in a homeless coronavirus quarantine place .
__label__0 to my neighbors , if you hear me coughing , ( which i ’ m sure you can ) just know it ’ s the shatter . no coronavirus virus here ✌ 🏼 # shatterday # washyourhands and bongs
__label__0 i need to find a girlfriend asap before we go in this coronavirus quarantine 😣
__label__0 seattle , i will not be using your homeless coronavirus quarantine for the # trump 2020 headquarters , i do not want any more demented unrequested entitlements like your murder by healthcare and social services . i work remotely anyway , since i can ' t be with the president all the time
__label__0 things like not having means to test coronavirus suspects in namibia will just make you conclude that our government is nonsense and useless . is a laboratories that we don ’ t have or lab technicians to carry out tests ? or is it affordability ? ? ? this really
__label__1 my sister just went to turkey for a week . on arrival there , her temperature was systematically taken . landing back here at # stansted - nothing . everyone waved straight through . how very lax . # coronavirus
__label__0 i ' m doing the self - quarantine thing . which is pretty much my every day life anyway . # coronavirus
__label__0 flights disrespectfully cheap . baby the coronavirus got the girlies shook . im booking like 3 flight right neow .
__label__1 my husband and i are both coughing like it ’ s nobody ’ s business . our house sounds * like a coronavirus breeding ground . * neither of us knowingly have the virus . . . # coronaphobia
__label__0 there was white men in my way while i was trying to walk back to my apartment so i started to take cough vigorously and them bitches parted like the red sea i love coronavirus
__label__1 may i just say that the pharmacy here in ny i ' ve visited several times in the past few weeks ? yeah well a pharmacist was confirmed to have the coronavirus today and the place is quarantined and i have a wicked cold at the moment so i ' m panicking (
__label__0 why are people buying all of the toilet roll ? ! have they looked at the symptoms of coronavirus , i ’ m not sure they ’ ll need it !
__label__1 i kno coronavirus is serious to some , but plz dont bother me . i just want to focus on school . i got sick af but i ’ m not overreacting saying i have it and going crazy .
__label__0 i just put a coronavirus quarantine sign on my door to discourage solicitors .
__label__1 they asked if there was a doctor on board mid flight , if i get coronavirus i swear . .
__label__0 who are you working for by covering up and not testing people for # coronavirus you and your family are in the same boat as us # houstonrodeo needs to stop # testvirusnow # coronavirustesting
__label__0 i don ’ t have coronavirus , i ’ m coughing because i just smoked weed .
__label__0 update on my call . . . just got a call back at 457 am . obviously when she asked for my confirmation # i read her the flight # cause i was asleep , but other than that , got everything handled . i can ’ t imagine the issues they ’ re dealing w / right now because of the # coronavirus
__label__0 prediction by hospital report is 480 , 000 deaths in us due to coronavirus .
__label__1 dear mel , any tests that see if people have had # covid ー 19 # coronavid 19 # coronavirus # covid 19 australia & amp ; not known ? i experienced same symptoms which hit hard after stopping in # hongkong mid sept 2019 - can tests pick up antibodies ? was on route to london to see another daughter
__label__0 even when we had listeriosis it was a joke , and coronavirus is a joke . we have a sick way of turning trajectories to joke . hence government relaxes because blacks are social media activists , who are keyboard aroused .
__label__0 based on the 3 times i ’ ve been sick this winter , and these symptoms , i could have easily had coronavirus and recovered from it 3 times already . # covid ー 19
__label__0 or it could be allergies , or a cold , or stress from overexerting myself — i highly doubt i got coronavirus . and if i did , it ’ s not like i could afford a test anyway .
__label__0 i ' d add why mortality is so high in italy ? - basically because italy is not sharing all the people who tested positively , only around 1 over 4 - italy is the 5 th countries in the world for old people ( and the average age of dead people for coronavirus is 81 years )
__label__0 so if everyone keeps masturbating we can rid the planet of the coronavirus ? i ’ ll get started now . . . . 😈 🥂
__label__0 i ' d block the words coronavirus and covid 19 etc because i ' m sick of seeing it , but no one spells it correctly anyway so i ' ll still see it 🙃
__label__0 me watching everybody freak out and i ' ve already stockpiled for the # coronavirus quarantine .
__label__0 i ’ ll admit to not knowing shit about the coronavirus until super recently , but my god those symptoms are not concerning at all . like the shit ain ’ t a severe illness to those living in countries like the u . s
__label__1 was refused a # coronavirus test of an elderly loved one who died of pneumonia on thurs . i had come back from overseas , and got cold / flu symptoms . i pushed , got the test , now i ’ m quarantined until the results for # covid 19 australia # covid 2019 our story
__label__0 coronavirus , is god ' s way of saying he has had enough of the human race / and our greed for money , power , capitalism etc just look what we have done to this planet earth , it be better without humans . ? ? ?
__label__1 it is funny , right around christmas my family and i all got sick . we all had our flu shots but still got sick with all that same symptoms of the coronavirus . my grandson and daughter had a mild case but me 56 went down hard .
__label__0 just went to tesco to do my usual weekly shop , expecting bogrollandsoapmageddon . sadly no . just a standard amount of those items on the shelves and everyone just mooching about normally . no one needed to be chinned . . . # coronavirus
__label__1 i ' ve had a dry tickly cough over the last few days but it ' s now evolved into a full blown lung regurgitation . does anyone know where in edinburgh that drive through coronavirus testing place is ?
__label__1 a lady behind me on my flight to adelaide just vomited in her coronavirus mask . it ’ s been nice knowing you all . . .
__label__0 in the meantime she ’ s come in contact with many others . it will spread . how do we quarantine everyone ? # coronavirus # covid 19 # coronavirususa
__label__0 can # pandocruises show us their # riskassessment for # coronavirus for cruises about to board in next weeks ?
__label__1 matt and i have been sick af all weekend & amp ; now he won ’ t shut up that we have the coronavirus bc i just had to fly to florida 😂 😂 💀
__label__0 so just went to do my weekly shop , and i wasn ’ t able to buy things that aren ’ t normally an issue , watch this brilliant video , and spread the word , stop # panicbuying because of # coronavirus think of others ! ! 🤦 ‍ ♀ ️
__label__0 so since the coronavirus is basically only dangerous for old people and sick people us young bois should go on vacations now since tickets and hotels are probably gonna be hella cheap in a few weeks / months . who ’ s down ? 👉 😂 👉
__label__0 seeing this graph , i have two hypotheses 1 . coronavirus started spreading faster due to either a new mutation or some environmental factor . 2 . in these two weeks the tests became way more sensitive and we started diagnosing cases that were missed or misdiagnosing patients .
__label__1 after about 48 hrs of traveling bus , train , flight . i went from the airport straight into the service , and saw yet again that the altar call still works . because it ’ s the work of the holy spirit . a passion for the work of the lord supersedes fatigue and coronavirus fears
__label__1 i might have coronavirus ( if i get quarantined there ’ s a chance i ’ ll make some new companions at least 😅
__label__0 there are 8 # coronavirus cases in the houston area , all of them were from egypt where it ' s still spreading . i called to inquire about delaying our flights to cairo . . . they ' re still charging a change fee . why ? # covid 19
__label__0 i sorry to announce am putting myself into voluntary self quarantine from coronavirus twitter
__label__0 what ' s the point . ? the end is getting closer , god has had enough of human being after what we have done to the planet coronavirus is god ' s way of saying i ' v had enough of humans
__label__0 i think the good doctor # bencarson was “ sleep talking . ” 😴 sleep 💤 # coronavirus
__label__0 me going to work at the height of the coronavirus pandemic because i ’ m a geriatric social worker so i truly legitimately can ’ t work from home
__label__0 coronavirus epidemic got me like fuck it . . . i ’ m booking another flight 🤪
__label__0 so you ’ re also telling me that i was just at eisenhower hospital a week ago and now there ’ s a coronavirus patient there ? ? ? ? ? ?
__label__0 just got back from the supermarket and i can confirm that people are stockpiling toilet rolls . i ’ m not convinced it ’ s because of the # coronavirus though as that would be idiotic . i blame & amp ; # saturdaynighttakeaway people just think they ’ re gonna get the squits ! 💩 💩
__label__1 it ’ s fair for people to ask me about coronavirus considering how sick i am but i tested positive for the flu and strep and that is what i have !
__label__0 the us surgeon general just lied to jake tapper by saying that doctors haven ’ t turned away anyone from testing for # coronavirus nor denied any doctor a test who has requested a test . this is a blatant lie .
__label__0 thanks to the coronavirus i got a round trip flight to los angeles for less than $ 200 . now i gotta find out what i wanna do there
__label__1 i ’ ve never seen so many people wiping down everything as i have on this airplane . there ’ s a lot of short fast movements & amp ; the faintly overwhelming scents of lysol , purell , and recycled air . # coronavirus # springbreak # betterthanthealternative .
__label__0 you guys should be embarrassed by the way you are treating customers trying to get home amidst coronavirus . you wouldn ’ t let my cousin change her return leg on her flight back to the us tonight from rome even though the flight is nearly empty . . . shame on you !
__label__0 if i call united and ask them to change my flight for no fee do you think the reason , “ i ’ m scared im going to over sleep and miss it and . . . coronavirus ! ” is enough ?
__label__0 one year ago i went on a cruise to cuba . at the time , this video frequently played on a tv channel . it amused me and i sent to my nephew and nieces . as coronavirus spreads across the us , it seems like a good time to share it
__label__1 thx for admitting iwould ’ ve been denied boarding in # puertorico before itook my flight i believe # coronavirus letters should ’ ve been directed at the “ most vulnerable ” ( elderly ) since oodles of ppl like me have “ low risk exposure ” . . ilook forward to cruising soon
__label__1 update on my brother ! ! out of hospital 👍 . . had a virus . . coronavirus , but not the dangerous one from china . . . but now a confirmed case in fort wayne , & amp ; 1 in indy !
__label__0 expect # borowitzreport to validate administration plan to place all americans on cruise ships to halt us # coronavirus case count
__label__0 i find it really annoying people saying # coronavirus is nothing to worry about it ’ s just like flu . . last time i had “ just the flu ” i was hospitalised due to it as i have severe asthma . things like this are scary for those with medical conditions .
__label__0 can someone please explain the logic of this decision ? ! i do not understand ! italy has quarantined 16 million people , yet the uk don ’ t care if people travel back from italy ? # coronavirusuk # coronavirus
__label__0 i hate my anxiety levels at the moment . like rational or not , the coronavirus updates are actually making my levels so high it makes me feel physically sick . media ain ' t helping and my phone is loving giving me pushed notifications constantly . rational ? anyone else ? . . .
__label__0 it is too soon for anyone to be falsifying records . job chapter 21 hints at this happening this time . my number counting is pretty good now . and falsehood is a strong accusation from god . i say this to say , i went to the strongest hospital system , there is no test . # coronavirus
__label__0 i love to travel and flight cost are real low right now . . . . am i that scared of the coronavirus ?
__label__0 asked about impact of using strict quarantine in one area of australia - i gave the pros and cons . subsequently received negative rude emails from public . told member of public that i had lived there once . . received an apology . need to be relatable when talking about # coronavirus
__label__0 used to sneeze and say " bless me " but coronavirus got us sneezing and doing the full lord ' s prayer . . . . . " our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . . . " # coronavirussa
__label__0 coronavirus not gonna stop me from trying to win this $ 3700 wsop st . maarten package . . . then can quarantine me after i win the main event .
__label__0 at this point i hope the coronavirus kills me i ’ m sick of this shit
__label__1 idk how to ask to work from home until coronavirus is under control . i take public transit for 1 . 5 hours each way to / from work in downtown san francisco & amp ; this is getting scary 😳
__label__0 as much as we all want the coronavirus quarantined and killed off , it does present a major threat to the president ’ s re - election because of the havoc it is raising in the markets . joe biden can say “ the economy is crashing on your watch , i can bring it back . ”
__label__0 it has killed many attending young doctors in china 🇨 🇳 , i don ’ t know why people are saying it doesn ’ t kill young people . many healthy young chinese are dying from # coronavirus , it ’ s irresponsible and insensitive for anyone to advance contrarian argument .
__label__0 went to raley ' s , brought my own bag , pick my 3 items , didn ' t touch anything else , paid at the self check out , and didn ' t get close to anyone . . 🤪 dang , the age of # coronavirus got home and washed my hands , done . 🙏
__label__0 don ’ t panic it might not be the coronavirus i just went through something similar i quarantine myself in my home use over - the - counter drugs i never got a fever and today i am better i am praying for you because our leaders don ’ t know what they are doing !
__label__0 my coronavirus survival supplies . if i ’ m quarantined for two weeks this should help . four cases of should cover my water needs .
__label__0 the # coronavirus is allowing my inner germophobe to be more socially acceptable . for your viewing pleasure and my sanity , please see this lovely 90 s film mrs . ehrenreicht made us watch in 9 th grade honors earth and space , teaching us how to cough safely
__label__0 am i the only one hoping for a coronavirus city closedown so i can stay home from work ?
__label__0 # puertorico has not reported # covid 19 aka # coronavirus because there ’ s not a single test for it in the hospitals . whenever this test gets available we will see the chaos . acuérdate que lo digo . . . 🥺
__label__0 a doctor in a damascus hospital tells me syrian hospitals are full of coronavirus patients , despite syrian government reporting zero cases .
__label__0 my trip to # japan next month to ski , see cherry blossoms , and go to a baseball game was scrapped thanks to the # coronavirus . here ’ s a memory from my only trip thus far to japan from 2007 , when i went to # jingustadium …
__label__0 so that ’ s why i haven ’ t been sick this year . coronavirus ain ’ t got shit on my sexual urges .
__label__0 my hometown in italy is under the # coronavirus lockdown . i spent 10 days looking after my sick ( not tested ) eldest niece remotely and now reassuring my pregnant youngest that they ’ ll be ok . not fun .
__label__0 i ' m not coughing because of coronavirus , i just laughed while eating a muffin and now there is muffin particulate in my lung
__label__0 i bet you guys haven ' t seen a review like this before . from now on with every cocktail you order i will cough directly into your mouth and give you free # coronavirus # barcode _ gg # covid 19 # coronavirusoutbreak # epidemic # pandemic # virus # cocktails # craftbeers # jameson
__label__0 if they let me leave the hospital with a # coronavirus , thatwouldpissoffthemayor . don ’ t nobody want all the news crews to come down to my hood to really see how i ’ m living . they would totally forget all about this virus . if they got to my floor at all # projects # elevators # riis
__label__0 hope there is no outbreak in boston . i am planning to move my family this week . struggling to make decisions whether i should take the flight back to my home where i have little girls and old parents # coronavirus # covid 19 # boston
__label__0 521 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the us . 21 deaths . that ' s a 4 % fatality rate . incredible how trump ' s cdc has not been able to roll out widespread testing to show people if they have cv and to get a more accurate fatality rate . # ncpol # coronavirus
__label__0 people say “ it ’ s like the flu ” but that is rather ignorant as the flu has both a vaccine and some tamiflu crap to help it , plus you can get tested easily . i got tested at a cvs clinic . until we have all of this for coronavirus ( yes , some will still die ) it ’ s not like the flu .
__label__0 i have to take the train 3 times in the next 3 weeks for doctor appointments and i am growing increasingly more freaked out at the prospect of it . the northeast corridor is one of the busiest rail lines in the country , someone probably has the coronavirus on there etc etc
__label__0 almost 70 degrees tomorrow in nyc , gonna need coronavirus to force my job to make working from home mandatory this week
__label__0 im actually sick and fucking tired of coronavirus now , the whole world has turned mental
__label__0 in my unit alone we have many people who cruise . after much discussion over the last few days at least 10 all future cruise bookers said they will never now consider and not spoken to everyone yet , appalled at their lack of understanding of this # coronavirus
__label__0 while everyone is worrying about the coronavirus , i got my carnival cruise certification . if you are thinking of going on a cruise in the future , there are some amazing sales now 🛳
__label__1 has kept distance and is well . i can ' t say what we had - - the stats are that the flu is more likely the culprit but our symptoms were consistent with coronavirus . i sneezed maybe 6 times all week ? it was all cough from the start and still is . the fever came second . all this to say
__label__0 i do . correspondence with an md in pittsburgh who is upset by not being able to test ~ 9 patients . i can ’ t share details due to hipaa . i am a former investigative journalist and take accuracy seriously . thank you for asking . # coronavirus
__label__0 for my work place , if we call off bc we are sick ( coronavirus confirmed or not ) . we have to come in to get our temperature taken and have a doctors note + cannot come in to work for 7 unpaid days . if that was to happen to me , no way for me to pay all my bills .
__label__0 perk of knowing / having so many seminarian brothers as family is that even when in mandatory quarantine to make sure i don ’ t have # coronavirus , one of them still brought me the jesus and did a mini - prayer service with me while keeping distance . # verygrateful
__label__0 dear coronavirus , thanks for changing my flight ticket from $ 200 to $ 70 . i really appreciate it .
__label__0 if i self isolated every time i had a cold i would never leave my house again , but really how are you meant to know which ones the coronavirus ? !
__label__0 want to enact change ? tell your boss you got # coronavirus , if all us little people stay home so nobody makes any money we can fix the world . anyone comes to evict you cough on them and tell them you ' re in quarentine . think the government won ' t try to fix us . . . bet me !
__label__0 it ’ s just gonna keep going up until we all quarantine ! ! china ’ s number for new cases are going down because they are all quarantined # coronavirus america needs to get it together
__label__0 the coronavirus lying dormant on unsanitized hospital equipment entering my c * l * n tomorrow
__label__0 bunch of karens be running round asking “ how likely is it that # coronavirus will chill out in the next 4 months ? i have flights to book and globes to warm ” 🙄
__label__1 i generally have a low body temperature ( i ’ ve been 97 . 1 since 1989 when i got an unknown virus , then . you don ’ t get tested for coronavirus unless you ’ re above a certain temperature . i have a fever if i ’ m 98 . 6 . i don ’ t think they ’ ll ever test me . i ’ m weak and feel sicker . i ’ m 60 .
__label__0 coronavirus just broke out have you asked yourself who even gave it name # coronavirus these are all plans to just reduce population as thy planed , same as ebola later they will tell us they gonna live on another planet 🪐
__label__0 our state medical labs here say there ' s not enough test kits . the problem ? no one has tested positive in the state of michigan for the coronavirus ?
__label__0 he truly is a bastard . no doubt about that . imagine when he gets the coronavirus , because we ’ re past the point of containment and it ’ s now seemingly more likely the virus will be coast - to - coast . it ’ s traveling . we not quarantined . and too many haven ’ t been tested .
__label__0 coronavirus droppin flight prices is sending my ladiessss out to see me so honestly if i get it it ’ s fine
__label__0 tim went to the grocery store to stock up on essentials since coronavirus has made it ’ s was to stl . “ i wanted to be sure we were prepared for a quarantine . ” # hero # stockpilingjunkfood # covid 19 # coronavirus # prepper # icecream # frozenfoods # artistbrain
__label__0 it was so nice out today . but are you kidding me . high of 44 tomorrow ? ? and rain ! ? i ’ m too gay for nebraska ’ s weather . i think this is a sign that i just need to self quarantine tomorrow to stay away from the coronavirus and the weather .
__label__0 i don ' t have coronavirus . i ' m coughing cause my mom just made chile rojo 😭
__label__0 i ’ ve always laughed at the pat robertsons of the world when he ’ d blame things like hiv and hurricanes on the wrath of god . but cpac getting hit with the coronavirus with ted cruz in quarantine is causing me to rethink everything
__label__0 the family that ’ s tested positive for coronavirus traveled to italy , returned to kerala and then reportedly were in contact with nearly 3000 people . how did this family get past airport scrutiny ? if our airport authorities are lax , we will have no way to control # coronavirus
__label__1 when i got on the plane , there was 400 confirmed # coronavirus cases in the us . upon landing , it ’ s 550 . . . 😥
__label__0 me and my homegirls tippin through the airport cause y ’ all scared of the coronavirus and the flights are cheap as hell !
__label__0 from south africa going to eswatini using # ngwenyaborder we were scanned for coronavirus symptoms and on our way back to south africa we were not checked for the virus . . . is it because department is ready for the virus or they were not there at the time we pass ?
__label__0 only . 00016 % of the us population has been diagnosed with coronavirus and only 22 people ( . 0000067 % of the us population ) have passed away from it . 12000 people died from flu in 2019 . y ’ all need to chill . . . and you should ’ ve been washing your nasty ass hands before anyway
__label__0 so your response is to give a racist statement on the coronavirus ? you must sympathize with trump . sorry for your quarantine hope you dont get i ' ll . but , fuck you nonetheless i bet more gop ' ers run at risk , a cure will magically appear
__label__0 i ' m literally afraid to go out & amp ; when i have to , i avoid people - well - like the plague . if i ' m walking down the sidewalk & amp ; someone comes towards me i step off the curb into the street . in the supermarket i try to keep distance from everyone . # coronavirus # covid 2019
__label__0 coronavirus made traveling so cheap , my round trip flight to florida in may is gonna cost $ 102 . . .
__label__0 i ' m not afraid of coronavirus but if maybe someone in charge of me at work was so that i could work from home for a couple days i think i could be a little spooked
__label__0 me legit dying from sickness right now . . . . and no it ’ s not the coronavirus . . .
__label__0 this coronavirus bout fuck up my cruise 🤦 🏾 ‍ ♂ ️
__label__0 i asked my doctor if i had coronavirus . he said no .
__label__0 i too have decided to self - quarantine . . . not because i have the # coronavirus , but because i hate people
__label__0 and thanking the pilots , crew , engineers , doctors , diplomats , ops and many other experts who volunteered and operated our three qantas government coronavirus rescue flights from wuhan and tokyo . exceptional people all # spiritofaustralia
__label__0 lmao my boss told us he would be purchasing hundreds of dollars worth of purell to combat the spread of coronavirus , but won ’ t let us have the paid sick days we are manadated by law sksksjsjajahahsb if y ’ all wanna stay healthy , stay away from restaurants for the next few weeks
__label__1 it ’ s not looking good that i went to the hospital directly across the street from this campus , it ’ s in my hood , but i received pneumonia as my diagnosis . i ’ m telling you , see what you want , but # coronavirus is too rich for my blood . i just don ’ t fit the public demographic .
__label__0 about a month ago i was in orlando international and some kid yelled “ i have coronavirus ” and had people running away and got escorted out of the airport i can ’ t imagine how much more ridiculous the reaction would be now
__label__0 on my way to indonesia 🇮 🇩 to talk about # biodiversity and # naturebased solutions . . . unless . . . well . . . let ’ s see if we get on the plane ✈ ️ first # coronavirus
__label__0 my parents just flew into dublin and are gonna be in london and amsterdam if these mfs get the coronavirus i ’ ll be bummed 😂
__label__0 i really don ’ t understand why we are still allowing flights in to the uk from key areas of the infection like italy and south korea . surely airlines closing those routes now will reduce the risk for more draconian measures further down the line # coronavirus
__label__0 when i announced my flight fast to my mom , she said that i was paranoid about coronavirus . ' you can get contaminated in the restaurant or in a supermarket ' she said . true . but i cannot fast for food for 4 weeks without consequences , whereas i can abstain from flying with no harm .
__label__0 i ’ m not a medic either , but work in the # nhs machine , i manage doctors rosters and my team are almost never seen , i can ’ t knit doctors either , or clone them on demand for you , so stay away from a & amp ; e as they are all are human too 👩 ‍ ⚕ ️ 🥼 👨 ‍ ⚕ ️ # covid 19 # coronavirus # supportyournhs
__label__0 i used to have all these aspirations of travelling to different countries but those died way before coronavirus . my boys get sick every time we travel unless we sanitize every inch of the airplane / hotel / airbnb / etc . random fevers . it killed my desire to travel .
__label__0 this is appalling . you have one panellist . one . speaking sense and trying to have a rational discussion about coronavirus . meanwhile you have the editor of the sun making a mockery of it . laughing . and piers morgan lapping it up . made me sick .
__label__0 fuck coronavirus all my dawgs got bieber fever
__label__0 so i told my boss i am happy to self - isolate as long as i can come to work on mondays . why mondays ? my wife telework on mondays . # coronavirus
__label__0 its about time we ban all flights to and from countries affected by the coronavirus . # coronavirusinsa
__label__0 is this the " doctor " who called # coronavirus wuhanvirus ? ? ? i hope he stays inhouse for a damn long time , and please , make sure he has no internet , no phone , no whatever . just a little stone and a paper he could use . . .

__label__0 agree . hard to read but critical the messaging gets through . the reason italy are having to make those terrible decisions is insufficient critical care capacity . flattening the curve gives us a chance to cope - avoiding unnecessary mortality . we can ’ t avoid infection # coronavirus
__label__0 i absolutely love how quarantined italy has turned into a giant karaoke party 🇮 🇹 # coronavirus
__label__0 i ' m not surprised because i said it thursday . that a student told me that they are quarantining students and staff at hopkins in a dorm because someone may have been infected with the coronavirus . old news not breaking .
__label__0 just went to book something for my sister ' s hen night ( for the end of may ) and they ' re not taking bookings due to the coronavirus . jeez . when will this madness end 😢
__label__0 boomers are a bloody nightmare during this # coronavirus . my 72 yo dad “ i can ’ t run the business working from home ” . me “ dad , justin trudeau is running fucking canada working from home ” . 🤦 🏼 ‍ ♀ ️ # staysafe # stayhome
__label__0 if we ' re trying to avoid the same level of # coronavirus fallout as italy why have we gone all zombie apocalypse and cleared out the supermarket dried pasta and tinned tomatoes aisles ? we ' re all self - isolating with italian . it ' s the pastapocalyse !
__label__0 i ' ve been sick ass hell all week . . . by the time test are available i will be well . . . . thats the plan ! ! # coronaviruschallenge # covid 2019 uk # coronavirus # covid 19 # cpacvirus # daylightsavingtime # coronavirusillinois # coronavirusmo # coronavirususa # coronavirusmeme
__label__0 do you know the best part about living in texas with all this going on is . we have cedar fever that has very similar symptoms to the coronavirus .
__label__0 the hospital my son works at has satellite testing areas with virtual screening so possible coronavirus patients dont infect hospitals .
__label__1 . . my 6 yr was diagnosed w / coronavirus a month ago . we didnt know it was here yet , but it scared me so i asked if it was covid 19 . told me no . now i know we had no tests , so they couldnt have tested for it . does covid 19 show up as a positive for cv on a regular viral panel # msnbcanswers
__label__1 i wish i could take med remsivar trial . symptoms of coronavirus and treated for shortness of breath with steroids . and treated for pneumonia . very sick . steroids didn ' t help
__label__0 people let ’ s rely on science , common sense and human decency to get through the coronavirus because this virus shows religion for the scam it is . if religious folks want to act as therapists to help others that ' s great but when we beat the virus i hope we thank doctors not gods ! !
__label__0 watching a youtube video of some bloke explaining symptoms of # coronavirus and i don ’ t think his mrs appreciated the last explanation of where to put a certain femtometer .
__label__0 people are just idiots . no concept of reality . this is fuqing gross even if this coronavirus is not an issue . no wonder we are doomed when we treat flight attendants and other service people like this .
__label__1 someone pls explain to me why our skilled unit is still accepting new admissions and one of the most recents has pneumonia . . . . . . . . . . . . do we not know the signs and symptoms of coronavirus ? ? why are we risking taking on a patient w pneumonia . . . . . at a nursing home
__label__0 your ban on visitors at hospitals is resulting in my aunt being forced to leave the side of her terminal husband . please clarify your order to ensure she can be with him during his time of need . i get restrictions but let ’ s not lose our # humanity # coronavirus

__label__0 the wife and i are already laying down the ground rules for being quarantined together in order to save our marriage ! 😂 # coronavirus
__label__0 have faith . my thoughts on # presenteeism and why working from home is one benefit of # coronavirus in the long run was picked up by four different publications this week . links of which are given in this blog .
__label__1 hospital said i don ' t qualify for a coronavirus test because symptoms after a trip to brazil do not make you eligible . after nebulization and routine blood tests they discharged me and sent me back home , i decided …
__label__0 i went to high school in olympia , wa . this is a classmate who was basically told they have coronavirus today . i say basically because they didn ’ t “ officially ” test them . they won ’ t show up in washington ’ s reported total for confirmed cases . but they clearly have it .
__label__0 that some americans feel a need to stigmatize and blame china over the coronavirus hints to a deep pathology in our culture ; like we ’ re incapable of common , united action unless there ’ s an enemy we can isolate and * punish . *
__label__1 hey , dumb i have been a registered cardiopulmonary technologist for 35 years . and i was diagnosed with coronavirus 4 days ago after 2 hospital admissions in 10 days . 6 ft apart , zero shaking hands , and get the frigging tests . when it affects you or your loves . . . # covid _ 19

__label__0 there is no need to politicize this . we dont care about that . just focus on # covid 19 - all actions are appreciated . worry about the politics once we have cleared the illness . the views on # coronavirus mean more than your views on # cometogether
__label__0 a phone call to 305 - 642 - 5366 connects you with our doctors and clinical personnel 24 hours 7 days a week . # solohayunleon # medicareadvantage # hmo # miami # covid # coronavirus
__label__0 dear please drive a drive - thru # coronavirus test over to — sounds very sick on - air . we ’ re concerned about her . surely she wouldn ’ t come to work exposing others to # coronavirus , or violating cdc recommendations
__label__0 spent my 22 birthday self quarantined , first time i ’ ve ever had a birthday where i literally didn ’ t see anyone in person . # coronavirus
__label__0 first experience of in the united states has been great . owner letting my colleague and i stay an extra nine hours before our evening flight which was a big relief after many of the museums and attractions in washington dc are closed today due to # coronavirus
__label__1 about two weeks ago i had a fever , sore throat , runny nose , and cough . i realllly want to know if that was coronavirus or just a regular cold ( odds are regular cold given the timeline )
__label__0 i want to thank hospital staff , doctors , nurses , emt personnel , public health officials , governors , mayors and all who are helping in this # coronavirus response . we are grateful for your determination and your hard work on our behalf ! thank you !

__label__1 so of course i did . . . i went back to the hospital and they were reluctant to see me as i still had all of the symptoms . they sent me to a coronavirus pod . when i got there they told me to go into a room and call 111 again for the 3 rd time .
__label__0 3 . we have masks , sanitizer etc . 4 . anyone showing symptoms of any type stays home - no worries about sick days etc . 5 . our managers communicate effectively , constantly updating advice . 6 . none of our colleagues in dc have contracted coronavirus .
__label__1 i have a friend whose mother shows all symptoms of coronavirus and is a flight attendant so it ’ s very likely she came in contact with it but she was denied a test because she didn ’ t have a direct link she could name that could have given her it . what the actual fuck .
__label__1 so i went wycombe today , come back to aylesbury to find out someone died of coronavirus in wycombe hospital today . i have a cough and am sweating . gonna see how i go for the next couple of days . scary tho 😬
__label__0 question for you all ? on average how many people die of in the uk in 2019 flu type symptoms ? we have to take coronavirus seriously however we must stop the hysteria now ! let the experts and brilliant nhs sort this nightmare out . let ’ s just all be sensible and stop panic buying
__label__0 but did he take the google coronavirus symptoms survey screening 1 st ! ! ! ! ! we weren ’ t supposed to take the test unless we had symptoms ! ! !
__label__1 the doctor told my mom has all symptoms of coronavirus . she ’ s traveled recently . after hours of being on hold she was told they are only offering tests to severe cases and people 65 + . conclusion there are a lot more people who have coronavirus than the confirmed cases

__label__0 hear me out , what if we all take a 3 week quarantine and the # deptoftransportation has all road crews working 24 / 7 to complete all road construction projects # coronapocalypse # coronavirus # dot

__label__0 the pool has been closed cuz they ’ re doing maintenance but u asking if it ’ s closed cuz of the coronavirus but why were u tryna go if u were worried about that ? ! like y ’ all making me sick literally

__label__1 😂 😂 so true ! i feel so poorly that i considered lying and saying i ’ ve been to italy recently just so they ’ d take me seriously ! i was honest and was told to go to my gp despite having all symptoms of coronavirus !
__label__1 i think myself and my son have coronavirus too rachael , but it ' s an absolute joke we can ' t get tested so we ' re in the dark . the whole thing is a shambles , but i hope your daughter ' s ok . so far , we ' re fine , with only mild symptoms .
__label__1 i googled symptoms of coronavirus and i ’ ve got 5 of them
__label__1 bro i ’ ve been sick with respiratory illness since i worked a game with a person with a known case of corona virus and even tho i ’ m sick as hell and everyone else i worked with is , im not “ sick enough ” to even be considered for testing # coronavirus # cdcwonttestme
__label__1 annual checkup was 2 days ago . i went in with a cough , sore throat , low - grade fever . told the dr i thought i might need a flu test . he brought up the coronavirus test with me but we both agreed that it was alarmist and premature to take it . took a flu and strep test both negative
__label__1 day 13 of # coronavirus isolation and day 4 waiting for results . we called our doctor twice yesterday but no results as yet . however , now it is the weekend there is no system in place for us to call our gp to check for results so we have to wait until monday afternoon .
__label__1 guys i ' ve got a bad fever , i think i ' ve got the coronavirus 🤢 👻 the coronavirus
__label__1 sooo turns out i ' ve had direct contact with someone who may have coronavirus . do i self isolate ? do i go to work ?
__label__1 and as i sit here coughing and sneezing from what i can only assume is a case of coronavirus , the thought at the forefront of my mind is . . . at least i ’ m not a mets fan !
__label__1 i ’ m literally doing nothing but lying in my bed and i ’ m out of breath and i ’ m shaking . the tremors are getting worse and my fever is apparently really high . guess i have coronavirus 😩 🤟
__label__1 several pupils at my school are at home sick with flu like symptoms . a few staff members also . others like myself are starting to get sick . we are in lambeth borough amongst those with confirmed coronavirus or who don ’ t yet know . government needs to do more . # closeschoolsuk
__label__1 fever 99 . 8 with 3 / 5 kids fever also . it ’ s a subtle fever , had to go to school to pick up my daughter , . . my fever is sub clinical it let ’ s me continue work but the danger i see in this is there are probably many with # coronavirus # ncov infecting most that they come across with .
__label__1 i have 4 symptoms of coronavirus including coughing and sneezing . omg , what if i have it
__label__1 i didn ' t ! but i called the coronavirus hotline we had set up and by the time i called , i didn ' t have a fever so i was denied testing .
__label__1 trouble is none of us know how jumpy to be . i was due to go to an event for families today but didn ' t due to minor sniffles + cough , nowhere near anything even dignifying the label of ' a cold ' but i feared the looks i ' d get if a cough or sneeze were to sneak out . not # coronavirus !
__label__1 i ' m tired of trumpers telling me that i ' m being a hypochondriac . the coronavirus is literally in my neighborhood . my neighbor contracted it , possibly weeks ago . my brother has asthma and i have chronic bronchitis . we can ' t get tested . i have every fucking reason to be worried .
__label__1 bro i got like all the coronavirus symptoms wtf 😳 😳
__label__1 not sure if i have a bad cough or the coronavirus , but i am dying .
__label__1 # day 4 # coronavirus # coronaoutbreak # quarantine on # diamondprincess i don ’ t understand this . when someone make video w / criticism on crews , food , & amp ; the situation . did they think of 3000 + ppl feeling who experience the same hardship ? # complainisnotproductive # hanginthereprincess
__label__1 # selfisolationgame # coronavirusupdates # coronavirus # covid 19 temperature check at 715 pm - 37 . 8 ° c . shallow breathing is meh . deeper breaths cause pain & amp ; horrible cough i have this 3 rd day in a row - will you test me now ? ? my family & amp ; friends are freaking out . me too !
__label__1 honestly i ’ m blessed to have a workplace that is paranoid enough about coronavirus that they ’ d send me home for a cough and blowing my nose lmfao
__label__1 i think i have the coronavirus i ’ ve been coughing nonstop all day and i feel really warm
__label__1 im having the flu and fever but i am assuming its just a normal flu . # coronavirus
__label__1 i ’ ve had the same since monday night . hasn ’ t progressed or gotten any better . negative flu test . not enough coronavirus tests in ct to test cases like mine .
__label__1 / / rare 1 am selfie because i can ' t sleep . headaches , heatwaves , shivers , muscles stirring + the fact i ' ve slept the whole day . . . don ' t know if it ' s a simple flu or coronavirus though . . .
__label__1 i ' ve got a massive headache , can no longer breathe through my nose , every time i cough i think i ' m gonna throw up , and i ' ve felt like i ' m on the verge of shitting my pants for the past 3 hours . is this the coronavirus everyone talkin about ? is it deadly ? i sure hope so
__label__1 a car length away , thats how i can communicate with my daughter and her husband right now because we can ' t get test results back . # covid 19 # oklahoma
__label__1 if you want to know more about the coronavirus covid - 19 , u should read my blog post about what it was like for me going into the doctors office when they think you might have it . there is obviously a pandemic response plan that has already gone into effect
__label__1 there are so many people like me + friends . young , have all the symptoms , are in the er and not being tested . we want to be tested & amp ; counted . it ' s not happening ! # coronavirusoutbreak # coronavirus # covid 19 # testvirusnow # cdc # cdcwonttestme
__label__1 coronavirus starting to spread even more and ive been coughing a lot lately . . .
__label__1 for five days , i ' ve had 101 degree fever and cough , but my pcp says b / c i haven ' t had direct contact with someone with # coronavirus , i can ' t be tested for it right now . so much for the us testing 1 m people by eow !
__label__1 + infection and even prescribed me a medicated inhaler and cough suppressants over the phone , but i ' m not medically cleared from coronavirus unless i get tested and uw medicine is refusing to test unless you ' re basically dying .
__label__1 so happy i ' m not sick anymore huhu no more awkward feelings when i need to cough in public lol plus getting sick and then better in the midst of coronavirus feels like an accomplishment . tbh i really thought i had it .
__label__1 to everybody staring at me in the uni library , it ’ s a cold not fucking coronavirus stop staring and let me cough in peace
__label__1 i ' ve been diagnosed with the coronavirus .
__label__1 i was scared of actually having coronavirus bc i got sick the day i heard of it and i went to the er but it was just the flu . btw i only went to the er for a chest x ray bc i had 3 straight days of fevers
__label__1 i ’ ve been diagnosed with coronavirus . my doctor suggested i find a woman with lyme disease to balance things out .
__label__1 yes , mr president . you and your staff are giving the average american confusing messages . i ’ m one . i ’ m sitting in a large metro hospital with acute bronchitis copd brought on by a virus . yet , i wasn ’ t tested for coronavirus at all . not enough tests tests available . unsafe , thanks
__label__1 yo , i ' m showing signs of a fever , called my friend ' s wife who ' s a nurse , miss li , she ' ll come see me in a bit , i ' m in freaking great pain 😂 hope it ' s not # ncov 2019

__label__1 it will get better in warmer temperatures for sure . spring is right around the corner . just scarey the ' re still allowing flights , etc . my daughter has the flu . she went to dr friday and they didn ' t even test for coronavirus . i do believe low risk for now in us .
__label__1 today , feeling extremely tire , headache , chill will go to work i need the money i do not trust my intuition i do not trust the doctors & amp ; their employers the time i trust them give me regret # vancouver # coronavirus
__label__1 me hearing my daughter coughing and trying to justify if i should quarantine her in her room for two weeks so i dont catch the # coronavirus

__label__1 my wife has been sick for roughly two weeks , she works with children and i with the general public . they are refusing to give her a test even though she has all the symptoms , saying she won ’ t die because she ’ s young . what about the people we ’ ve come into contact with # coronavirus
__label__1 had a coughing fit on my way back home and 3 random dudes yelled " coronavirus " and honestly that ' s more attention than what i ' ve got in a couple weeks ngl
__label__1 i guess the flu - like symptoms i had yesterday was just induced by fatigue and not of the 2019 - ncov . gonna increase my water intake and will exercise more often this time . . .

__label__1 # askcdc where do i go to get a coronavirus test ? i ’ ve called at least 4 places and each hospital tells me to call the hotline who then says call hospitals or your doctor who both are saying “ they don ’ t do that here ” i haven ’ t traveled or come in contact w / anyone who has covid 19
__label__1 my hypochondriac ass when i woke up with a mild cough and my anxiety spiraling into thinking i now have the coronavirus
__label__1 i ' m sick of being told that if i don ' t have # covid 19 symptoms , i don ' t need a test . # coronavirus is asymptomatic in some people - meaning i could have it without having any obvious symptoms . having it can infect others . we need to be testing everyone so those who have it know
__label__1 i ' ve already gotten sick twice this year so far and now i ' m dealing with a dry cough and sore throat . but tbh i ' m not that worried cuz i usually recover within a few days . and if i have coronavirus and i die then oof

__label__0 trump is not going to visit cdc today because he doesn ’ t want to “ interfere ” . too late . he ’ s told us coronavirus is a hoax . he wants to go by hunches instead of science . he says it ’ s not that bad . he is not making testing kits readily available . he has interfered every single day .

__label__0 honestly , i ’ m about to kill myself too . between already barely making ends meet , having severe chronic illness , dignity health not allowing us to work at home or pay us sick leave during a pandemic , on top of the pain i live through . . . my fsa is gone . death is so much better .
__label__0 might i just take a moment to say . . . not everyone wearing a mask right now is “ afraid of the coronavirus ” or “ being racist . ” example me . i wear a mask everywhere in public during the winter “ sick season ” because i am immunocompromised and can die very easily from common illness .
__label__0 oh and while i ' m being honest . . . you know when you use concern over coronavirus to " whatabout " other illnesses ? no one else is saying the other illnesses don ' t " matter " . . . we ' re just talking about this specific illness . sound familiar ? look at yourself .

__label__0 in a spectrum of outcomes , like say the coronavirus , its sometimes smart to plan for a bit of the extreme unpleasant stuff . the likelihood of a quarantine in the us is low , but the worst outcome of buying some dried foods , is youll have some extra dried foods .
__label__0 this is where we are thanks to trump ’ s incompetence and lies . the coronavirus will spread like wild fire because america is currently not testing people , and then isolating those who test positive . trump is a clear and present danger to the health of all americans .

__label__0 why not bring them back , quarantine them till we are sure they ' re fine ? desperate , they ' ll find a way out of china & amp ; come back illegally . this poses a greater risk . we can ' t control our borders or prevent # coronavirus from getting here . we better be prepared . it ' s now in egypt .

__label__0 i ' m already self isolating . where i live has 90 suspected cases of coronavirus and our gov ' t . is actually taking action on this .
__label__0 i can ’ t speak for its current state but i think there were a lot of lessons learned from the 2015 mers outbreak in which we saw a lot of hospital transmission via multiple - patient rooms , busy eds & amp ; long wait times , delays in iso , hospital / md shopping , & amp ; family engagement in care
__label__0 is trump stalling the test kits for the coronavirus and preventative measures so he can quarantine the us ( like is being done in other countries ) in november to prevent the elections and keep himself in the presidency ? this would be exactly how he and the republicans work .

__label__0 i know . it ' s very close to home now - someone with coronavirus died in my local hospital yesterday . johnson and his goons would rather elderly and vulnerable people died than admit our nhs can ' t cope with the load .
__label__0 the fact that the u . s . isn ’ t providing tests for the coronavirus is the reason why it has been spreading so much . the reasoning behind not testing is absolutely ridiculous as well because the rest of the world is taking serious action . i ’ m sick of the government putting people ’ s

__label__0 # coronavirus as gps we are only allowed to test patients for coronavirus if we get permission from sa health who don ’ t yet consider transmission from infected patients prior to the onset of symptoms . why are our hand being tied behind our backs ?
__label__0 made the mistake of blocking anyone who talked about coronavirus as fancied a change in content . now i ' ve self isolated on twitter inadvertently . # damncoronavirus
__label__0 now that we are testing , these numbers will grow . it ' s almost certain that up until now a number of deaths attributed to ' flu ' may in fact have been coronavirus . we are still only doing a handful of tests a day . we need to be testing thousands instead .
__label__0 why don ’ t we have kits in america . we should all stay home . and tank the markets . trump only cares about the markets . # coronavirus

__label__0 methinks im gonna have to quit my job because of coronavirus . . . i don ’ t wanna get sick and i interact with hundreds of people a day . . .
__label__0 yes . mortality rate of wuhan coronavirus is much lower in western countries is probably because there are still not enough cases in these countries . if millions of people were affected , hospital facilities are not sufficient , i guess mortality rate could be 10 % like china now .
__label__0 so , i see a lot of threads going around about " why can organization x do y thing in response to coronavirus when they couldn ' t do it before ? " ( e . g . wfh accommodation , online learning , etc . ) there ' s a lot of justified pain in these threads . i don ' t want to diminish it .

__label__0 given the zero ( 0 ) days of statutory sick pay , if i were american , i would simply contract coronavirus .
__label__0 same thing here . coronavirus has already been confirmed in the village , & amp ; our hospital has about two ~ icu beds & amp ; no full diagnostic equipment . it ' s also bottom of the list when beds are available elsewhere . ( 4 yrs ago , my mother died there due to this . )
__label__0 one quarantine i can definitely recommend is staying away from relatives when all that ' s on the news is coronavirus and politics .

__label__0 i only asked if any scientific tests have been carried out on coronavirus yet ? if no , then isn ' t anything worth a try or do people just die waiting for big pharma . most medications come from some plant .
__label__0 i wish climate change was a contributing factor of the coronavirus then maybe we would care about our planet 🤷 🏽 ‍ ♂ ️
__label__0 question regarding coronavirus and specifically the us economy how can someone diagnosed w the virus afford to take a month off work ? almost half of americans live paycheck to paycheck and very few employers give special pto ( and even fewer cover a month )
__label__0 i will never go on a cruise . and that was a pre - coronavirus stance
__label__0 when we come back to talk about human rights . the example of those " coronavirus " pranksters in an abuja hospital will readily become useful . we all have human rights , but when your actions / words threaten other people ' s human rights , yours can / should be rightly taken away from you

__label__0 seasonal flu only has an ro of 1 . 3 . the pandemic of only a few years ago was only 1 . 5 . corona virus travels and sheds when people have no symptoms . sars we had been able to contain because we could isolate it as it only transmitted when people had symptoms .
__label__0 mood , i work as a cashier in the only big pharmacy in town and have a slightly compromised immune system due to diabetes . it ' d be a lie if i said it didn ' t bother me when someone coughing and hacking comes in , even when there ' s not a pandemic on our hands .

__label__0 i am not shocked at the lack of compassion these days , but these are all human beings . sars killed 9 % of infected . the coronavirus is at 2 % . being quarantined is tough and i am scared , too . but , we need a plan , not panic or isolationism . the flu kills more in the us .
__label__0 when coughs are symptom of the coronavirus , i find it disrespectful for vicks cough syrup to capitalize off of this through ads on the radio . just give your kids some cough syrup and send them to school . great promo , dicks cough syrup .

__label__0 more than 3 , 000 people have succumbed to # coronavirus yet , according to the world health organization , # airpollution alone – just one aspect of our central planetary crisis – kills seven million people every year . why we don ’ t treat environmental issues with the same emergency ?

__label__0 as a community , we seem to be doing our best to socially isolate , distance and # flattenthecurve if not # plankthecurve . i don ’ t believe we need more motivation - but this sad story out of milton will further embed the stay home narrative in our minds # covidcanada # socialdistance

__label__0 yeah . pass a law against the pain of the coming us coronavirus outbreak and the people dying from unaffordable healthcare and stolen tax money wasted on orange spray tans and gilded shitters
__label__0 coronavirus is a great selling point for medicare for all and having federally guaranteed paid sick leave . we ' re only as safe as the least insured among us and it cost one guy $ 3 k to get tested for the virus out of pocket lol .
__label__0 is it just me or has it been surprisingly quiet in india on coronavirus front ? no cases or not enough testing capacity ?
__label__0 you have “ experts ” saying two different things ! i was fitted because i am working at a hospital and i have to provide care for people whether they have coronavirus , ebola , tb , etc ! i put my well being in front of others for living ! so to say i only care for myself is false !
__label__0 whilst visiting a friend in hospital i noticed the current status for those who have visited # wuhanchina in the last 14 days # coronavirus
__label__0 us official warns of likely " severe disruptions " due to # wuhan # coronavirus # covid 2019 . fed govt likely not much help as prez gutted pandemic team in 2018 . some big city university hospitals shockingly quiet . time for us citizens to hitch up our britches .
__label__0 only a matter of time until this happens in the us . we will all get coronavirus eventually but the spread has to be slowed down as we don ’ t have hospital capacity for the 20 % of cases that are severe .

__label__0 sorry to post this here but . . . there ’ s 3 coronavirus cases in my town and 73 in total in france . the government is prohibiting us to wear masks if we aren ’ t sick ? ! wth ? the drugstores won ’ t sold us any masks if we sonny have any prescription from a doctor .
__label__0 so if anyone flying back from china tonight has coronavirus they ’ re gonna be taken to my city ’ s hospital which is right over the road from my uni . . wow
__label__0 so , i guess that makes me disposable ! at 66 , with copd , chrons , and being retired , i don ’ t put $ into the economy , so doctors won ’ t save me when i get sick ! gop senator says only small percentage of population might die of coronavirus
__label__0 the coronavirus gives us the opportunity to buy cheap flights pretty much everywhere . . . i see this as an absolute win
__label__0 having watched the “ debate ” about coronavirus i can ’ t help thinking about when i was 15 & amp ; went to bed in oct 1962 , not knowing if i ’ d survive & amp ; see my parents again . closest we came to billions dead . umpteen crises since . that ’ s why i ’ m an optimist .
__label__0 0 died from covd - 19 and 7 recovered & amp ; went home in korea . coronavirus is less deadly than american influenza that killed 68 children already & amp ; infected more than 26 million americans . we should quarantine the influenza - infected americans & amp ; ban from traveling abroad . thoughts ?
__label__0 # coronavirus whistleblower in the # us says # health workers who had contact with # quarantined americans lacked training and gear . did i hear # african countries weren ’ t prepared to tackle # covid 2019 . # us is also being exposed !
__label__0 wanna understand why # socialdistancing is the most important action we all can & amp ; must take ? take a look at this excellent example of data insights and simulators in telling important stories . # coronavirus # covid 19 # everyonecounts # covid ー 19 uk
__label__0 no , clorax or bleach or other stuff don ’ t treat coronavirus infections . health facilities are better placed to treat infected people . our job is to maintain a distance , stay home , decompress and relax . stress free . don ’ t panic . all will be well .
__label__0 everyone moving in from china should be held in quarantine for 14 days . our best shot at stopping coronavirus from getting here is suspending all flights from china .
__label__0 yeah because of the coronavirus unfortunately . but maybe it ’ s for the better . i would be so pissed in the off chance i would need quarantined for 2 weeks across the country
__label__0 at the hospital , we ' re not allowed to go to pacific coffee as it ' s in a different block to where our appointment is . i ' m surprised they let me in the hospital in the first place , i was told on the phone only one parent was allowed # coronavirus # hongkong
__label__0 trump was reportedly ' furious ' after officials flew americans with the coronavirus back to the us from a quarantined cruise ship in japan without telling him # smartnews
__label__0 what i don ' t understand is the idea that a delay to quarantine measures is appropriate until that cases demand it . surely if we know that self quarantine of a with cough symptoms works , do it asap ! # coronavirus # flattenthecurve
__label__0 i wanna catch coronavirus just so i can cough on u
__label__0 20 % of cases on ncov 2019 will need a hospital bed and life saving treatment . we have less than 1 bed per 100 people in the usa . an outbreak here would quickly overrun the medical system . we also have a shortage of doctors .
__label__0 i ’ m very confused about all this toilet paper hoarding for # coronavirus i thought it was a cough not diarrhea 🧐
__label__0 everyone panic shopping for coronavirus doomsday at costco is still stopping to gobble down samples bc , i guess , nobody actually understands how illnesses spread lol .
__label__0 other people freaking out about corona virus . . . me - flights to bangkok for christmas are going to be cheap ! ! ( nope , not worried in the slightest . we survived actual sars ) 😏
__label__0 trump literally gave the green light to fly americans from the cruise ship back to the us against cdc ’ s advice . when 14 / 324 tested positive for # coronavirus , he was furious & amp ; said he wasn ’ t told any were infected .
__label__0 i feel like i ’ m making myself sick by reading all this coronavirus stuff . now it ’ s in europe and i ’ m traveling to london and paris this week ! i ’ m gonna be the one to catch it and will most likely die
__label__0 convenient that there ’ s panic about coronavirus with 500 reported deaths , and inconvenient that there ’ s no panic about the flu pandemic in the us with 10 , 000 deaths and 180 , 000 hospitalised so far since september . but hey , scary communist china is worse !
__label__0 i returned from uk 2 days ago and was pleased to see the arrangements at islamabad airports against coronavirus by checking temperatures n gathering information . . . . . my further suggestion is that government should take similar measurements in psl matches .
__label__0 reply from hr thanks for the information . we are sending team of doctors to your place for check up . if coronavirus is detected then you will be quarantined for 14 day ’ s at your home with paid leave .

__label__0 is a total failure . seven weeks to prepare for the coronavirus and as far as i can tell didn ' t prepare even one test kit . but he went on air saying we ' d have zero cases by now . we have thousands .
__label__0 a woman would suggest we do widespread flu / pneumonia / strep testing to eliminate those people from the potential coronavirus testing pool . there may be folks with both , but i would think it would streamline triage . you can tackle a problem by both inclusion and exclusion .

__label__0 can you please at least consider your position in the community and the weight your words carry ? can you at least get your facts straight before saying something like this ? there are coronavirus carriers who don ’ t show symptoms at all , we don ’ t know who ’ s “ healthy ” without tests .

__label__0 chilling bro i got that coronavirus so i ’ m sick at the crib 😂
__label__0 the oecd has good data on this . e . g . germany has about 8 hospital beds per 1 , 000 people . if we only assume that 1 / 4 is slack that can be used up by coronavirus without crowding out other patients , that would give us about 2 beds per 1 , 000 / 1
__label__0 so , bc the trump administration is refusing to let the send out # covid 19 testing kits , the only way to get tested if you feel # coronavirus symptoms , is to go and sit in a crowded emergency room , chock full of sick people , with lowered immunity . i ’ m sure that ’ ll end well .

__label__0 my hospitals admin just settled on a vendors bid to supply staff w / ppe for the coronavirus .
__label__0 brilliant & amp ; useful . social distancing seems to be the best strategy . let ' s do our best to flatten the curve , folks . stay safe , but stay in touch . these simulations show how to flatten the coronavirus growth curve
__label__0 so , the coronavirus is spreading without symptoms . which means that it ' s near impossible to know who is sick until they show symptoms . i hope our african governments are taking huge measures before we appear on the coronavirus map . p . s no known cure or vaccination .
__label__0 i m watch the tv serious again those days . i hate this feeling like just stay at home , cause the # ncp ( new coronavirus pneumonic ) is keep running in china . hope the # china can fight for this virus . i m chinese , body safe first ! fighting ! we will be great 👍 🇨 🇳

__label__0 hi i went to your location at eglinton ave east and amid the whole coronavirus situation you would think your stores should be following proper protocol regarding cleaning . i could even wash my hands in this sink . . . not to mention my burger was still frozen ?
__label__0 the first # coronavirus patient in the us had traveled to # wuhan # china before visiting a health care facility . read the case report published in
__label__0 i ' m not shocked or scared by the coronavirus . i have always thought the planet has a significant potential for zoonotic disease emergence , due to continued , high - level environmental changes . global warming is real & amp ; if it doesn ' t get under control it will definitely harm us .
__label__0 to counter # coronavirus effectively , countries worldwide must apply equivalent measures but any laxity by countries undermines others ’ efforts . a us friend tells me there is only one hospital in the entire # dc metro area equipped to test for and treat coronavirus cases .
__label__0 if i stay home from work for 14 days because of suspected coronavirus , i cannot return to work until i have a doctor ' s note that i ' m clear of it . how will i get a note if there are no tests ? ?
__label__0 y ’ all idk if the symptoms i ’ m having are linked to coronavirus like i got this big fat juicy moose pussy and i ’ m scared i ’ m -
__label__0 we must express our grateful thanks to all the doctors , nurses , paramedics , hospital staff , scientists , etc . who are relentlessly fighting the # coronavirus # pandemic round the clock at a great personal risk to their own lives . they deserve an applause . pls . like & amp ; rt # chinavirus
__label__0 guilty of not taking the coronavirus seriously enough . after all that i ' ve read now , definitely going to socially distance myself and would advocate all of you to do the same . being paranoid is better than living with the guilt of contracting it to someone who may not survive it .
__label__0 even if i knew was going to win . . . and i knew i would get # coronavirus to go out and vote for him . . . i ' d still vote , and then self - isolate !
__label__0 on this coronavirus , i am not worried about the competence of our doctors , but the docility of the current administration . everything about this administration has been reactive .
__label__0 it seems like the biggest worry is how contagious coronavirus is ; however , even if it ’ s contagious , but not “ that bad ” for most ppl , why panic ? that ’ s why i want to know hospitalization rate - to see just how “ bad ” this virus is . # of infected ppl doesn ’ t really tell us anything .
__label__0 # thestoryofroy well this is a bitch . we finally get the right id number for roy so he can receive commissary . we only had cash so send via western union so i went to walgreens ( nearest kiosk ) . guess what . the sons of bitches decided because coronavirus ww can ' t use them ! 1 / 2

__label__0 so it ' s more like finally given to the public to know . . . i ' m scared and worried over coronavirus in both ways - as a human living on this planet dealing with our dying planet , sickness and everything and as a person , who has plans and dreams . it ' s so fucked up i hope the cure
__label__0 i ' d like to clarify that this strain in cats is not lethal and that my sick kitties are doing much better . sidney sneezes a lot still and it gets in his eye sometime , which irritates it . here one is is squinty because of that . # coronavirus vs . # supercoronavirus .
__label__0 the silver lining is that we ’ re all getting an extraordinary amount of time with our families . while some have lost and will lose loved ones let ’ s appreciate the time we have with them today . just stay home . # coronavirus # covid 19 # coronaviruspandemic
__label__0 this damn coronavirus got everybody hitting me telling me to stay my ass off the plane butttt that ’ s not going to happen

__label__0 you must understand why the # coronavirus detection kits were pulled from use . they include too many false positives meaning we would overdiagnose the virus when it was not present . in other words , the tests are not reliable and creates more confusion . # testreliability
__label__0 probably his hospital staffs thank him for calling me in skype . what they are afraid of is someone bringing new coronavirus . kidney disease is one of basal diseases , and people with any of them can go advancing in severity very easily when they get infected with new coronavirus .

__label__0 i think he ' s not pushing the chain of inferences back far enough . the question is " why do we have a belief that the person has coronavirus ? " if that belief is because they have flulike symptoms , a positive flu test makes the probability of covid = p ( symptomatic , flu , covid ) .

__label__0 so you ’ re telling me if i get the coronavirus i get to be quarantined away from people , get to sleep majority of the day , and get to play my video games ? sign me up !
__label__0 the # coronavirus just got me 2 wks off from work with pay 😉 # lifeisgood
__label__0 so far , the says 5 us airports that are screening passengers for symptoms of the coronavirus include atlanta , chicago , san francisco , los angeles and new york

__label__0 says the coronavirus is no big deal and is totally contained , so he has nothing to worry about since he may have been exposed to it . can we quarantine him for 14 days ? # trumpviruscoverup
__label__0 check your medical folks . just read a blood test for coronavirus costs $ 3 , 200 . trump ' s wh already said i won ' t be able to afford the vaccine . if i can ' t afford the test , how will i afford the treatment ?
__label__0 sooo . . i have major health anxiety and ocd ( washing hands excessively ) and now coronavirus seems to spread to germany too . i ' m honestly so scared . my mom is a nurse and my boyfriend ' s close family includes a doctor and a doctor ' s assisant . 😰
__label__0 ashamed to say i have already eaten 1 / 2 of my coronavirus quarantine groceries ( i will not last a week in an apocalypse .
__label__0 # tedcruz is going into self - quarantine showing us that even in times of tragedy & amp ; crisis , we can still find time to celebrate small things like ted cruz not being out & amp ; about in public . i do wonder how # coronavirus is dealing with its ted cruz infection .
__label__0 um . . . my tweet this morning it ' s so very sick and wrong of me to hope that trump is all wrong about the coronavirus and that it destroys his presidency - isn ' t it ?
__label__0 i went to buy something at a chinese store i always shop at and it was half dilapidated in the middle of doing inventory despite being open . store lady apologized and said they weren ' t expecting anyone because with the coronavirus situation almost no one has been showing up (

__label__0 hey carma , based on your symptoms i am afraid this is coronavirus indeed . i have seen many examples from wuhan and china in past 2 months . some of the patients have no symptoms and xray showing lung damage already caused by the virus . test for flu is not enough . pray for u !

__label__0 coronavirus shows america can ' t isolate itself from world . we collaborate globally or suffer . us can ' t isolate itself from infectious diseases or rising global temps . in 2018 , us did this cdc to cut by 80 percent efforts to prevent global disease outbreak
__label__0 so if the test for # coronavirus is $ 3200 , do we just cough on the upper 1 % and have them get tested ? i ' m asking for a friend . 🤔
__label__0 trump is lying to us as usuall and not alowing the sick to be tested for coronavirus . we have our own tests and now hes blocking those ! ! what on earth - hes trying to kill us ! ! ? ? . crimes against humanity . my god stop him someone !
__label__0 i asked my mother if she knew the westchester man who had coronavirus and she told me she knew what synagogue he went to , but she , unlike me , wasn ' t joking .

__label__0 the initial news report seemed like reverse genetics - it was isolation . good work to the and team for getting there fast . i know there are others making / made isolates and reagents , working tirelessly just to aid the outbreak , # ncov 2019
__label__0 im not an expert but the importance of “ community spread ” of # coronavirus is that we are past bans or quarantines and now catching it from each other not them somewhere across the world . we are the community with the virus . hope this helps explain why the word community is focus

__label__0 china built a 1 , 000 - bed hospital in wuhan in 10 days . i wonder if there ' s a place in u . s . where this could be done if needed . not likely . ( though i could imagine being able to muster the workforce and organization needed . ) # coronavirususa # coronavirus # covid 2019

__label__0 are we just going to quarantine anyone who gets # coronavirus even though you ' re infectious before you present symptoms ? you would have already infected people . everyone can ' t sit in quarantine , it ' s going to be a domino effect where everyone will end up in it . and then what ?

__label__0 we desperately need to follow south korea ' s example here in america , esp . in cities where community spread # covid _ 19 cases of unknown origin are occuring . also , lack of insurance or money just can ' t be a barrier to # coronavirus testing if there ' s any hope of controlling it .

__label__0 its such a simple concept coronavirus , no vaccine , less than 1000 deaths so far . common flu , has a vaccine , minimum 12 , 000 americans die every year . china doesnt have an issue keeping its billions of people alive from common illnesses unlike the us , but that isnt talked about
__label__0 coronavirus . i volunteer as tribute . take me from this planet .
__label__0 it was a flight going too icheon ? i don ’ t see how it ’ s a problem to have it written in korean . apparently a flight attendant said something about coronavirus , but i don ’ t see a problem with that either bc that ’ s a real problem that people have to be weary and cautious of .
__label__0 i think we just need to wait and see what happens i don ’ t think as many will stay home as it seems like they ’ re saying right now . especially bc who knows what will come of this coronavirus and how much worse he ’ s going to look being so ill equipt to deal with it .
__label__0 im really getting sick of people mouthing off about coronavirus when they obviously don ’ t understand that it in fact can be dangerous to some . people with pre existing conditions are at a much greater risk , and because of that some people have the right to be concerned .

__label__0 at least i can tell i don ' t have the modern plague because a telltale symptom is fever and nobody ' s calling me hot , so apparently it ' s obvious from a distance that i ' m virus - free ! never mind that nobody ever does . clearly folks were just extra prepared for the sars outbreak .
__label__0 i ' m grateful to still have a job during this pandemic as many people i know are continuing to lose theirs . but damn , as someone with social anxiety & amp ; agoraphobia , i sure am jealous i don ' t get to stay home & amp ; quarantine . i ' d love a staycation right about now . # healthcareworkers

__label__0 excellent discussion on the health effects of emf / rf radiation , 2 g through 8 g , how 5 g is affecting the coronavirus , and the impact on human life and our planet
__label__0 so as a person who sees a specialist at the hospital for something i ’ ve been struggling with for a decade , to ring to find he ’ s booked up till the end of march because of the fear of the coronavirus , it ’ s really upsetting how the media has fed this level of panic .
__label__0 great piece bella , my hope too is that this pandemic forces up to see the bigger picture , how we treat the planet and how we and multiple species are impacted by what we do . there is another way , rebuild community and look out for one another . stay safe
__label__0 quarantined cruise ship passenger speaks out against us coronavirus evacuation plan
__label__0 coronavirus is not permanent . your body eventually fights it off . why do you say people need to get tested ? do people get tested for the flu ? we have a new strain of flu and need new vaccines every year . flu now is more deadly than this . enough of the misinformation nonsense
__label__0 we can ' t test for # coronavirus in the us because trump ' s underfunded cdc made faulty test kits . we are blind to the extent of the contagion . no way to confirm patients have the disease because hospitals have no test kits . the trump admin . is incompetent .
__label__0 ignorant . more people die from the flu because aside from vaccines we do nothing to prevent the spread of the flu . for months we have actively been trying to quarantine and contain covid - 19 . by the way that ’ s the name not “ the coronavirus . ” right now the global fatality rate
__label__0 someone asked me just because flights are cheap you ’ re going to risk catching coronavirus . . . nigga duh

__label__0 and stop spreading the # coronavirus , he still hasn ' t taken the test . hopefully when he faints it will be at the mic . he probably already passed out at the white house but they are probably hiding it from us . what happened to the shadow government people ? we need the truth .
__label__0 i have been diagnosed with the coronavirus . i ’ m kidding , but just leave me alone while i ’ m at the gym and the grocery store .
__label__0 and then you get on a plane and when the captain says we have a customer traveling with us with a severe . . . * gasp * nut allergy , the entire plane holds their breath thinking it ’ s something with coronavirus 😂
__label__0 oh , my heart aches for this student . imagine the stares she had to brave to wear such full protection gear . and the fear of catching the virus during the long flight . what diabolical times we live in ! ! i am so mad with this # coronavirus & amp ; the people responsible !
__label__0 i agree govt has devalued the profession for long time . but what we are facing now needs all who can help . its just a small request to all ( not just retired folks ) to join the battle to tackle the # coronaviruschallenge # coronavirus # nhs
__label__0 our primary demands 1 . evacuate us asap 2 . make quarantine units for us . # evacuatepakistanistudents # wuhancoronavirus # pakistan
__label__0 if the coronavirus was found on a kiwi on one of the cruise ships , it makes me think it has been created in a lab with a fungus of some type that allows it to spread quicker from contact from the host to anything the host touches
__label__0 coronavirus is like flu ? what are the symptoms guys ? please , i ' m too young to die 😭 😂 😂
__label__0 / / the coronavirus has spread to my country now though agsjdhsjd . the doctors usually just tell me to go and eat fruit when i see them .
__label__0 if the uk don ' t close there schools , pubs , restaurants , buses , salons and tattoo studios uk population will increase with more deaths . stand together and stay at home like us irish nation # coronavirus # covid 19 # coronavirusoutbreak # coronavirusireland # lockdownireland
__label__0 this coronavirus thing is the only time in my entire life when reading about an illness has actually made me panic less . the headlines are so fucking alarmist that browsing just those almost sent me spiraling
__label__0 i ' m sick n tired now of here about # coronavirus this # coronavirus that and # coronavirusireland and # coronavirusupdate i dont care and it ' s still trending like mad ! ! ! ever since january and now the 1 st of march it ' s gonna be like throughout the year 2020 enough all already 🙄

__label__0 how ' namaste ' flew away from us the continued spread of the deadly coronavirus that originated in wuhan , china , is often compared with the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic of nearly two decades ago that affected more than 8 leon draisaitl # missamerciana
__label__0 ( 3 / 7 ) that us evacuation flight from wuhan to cali finally landed - to * cheers * . the ~ 200 americans will stay at march air base for 3 days then allowed to go home but undergo “ active monitoring ” for 14 days for # wuhancoronavirus . there ’ s still public concern . is here .
__label__0 maybe the reaction to coronavirus is warranted . even though young people aren ’ t at much risk of serious illness , even a 2 % mortality rate is crazy . that ’ s over 6 million people in the us dead if we all end up sick .
__label__0 after 2 hours in a dusseldorf hospital to be told i ' ve torn my calf i have decided to have my 2 strong painkillers at once and get pissed . i will be out tomorrow night . . . im bound to get sympathy from some hot skinny sympathetic german bird 😁 . # dusseldorf # coronavirus # carnival

__label__0 trump furious americans infected with coronavirus flew back to us without his permission report # foxnews
__label__0 people across us say they ’ re being denied coronavirus test
__label__0 so the bad news is i feel kinda sick the worse news is coronavirus exists the worst news is im asian ( viet ) so i have 0 rights ( ( ( ( (
__label__0 we don ' t even know what they died from . no doctor nor the me has said it was from or due to the coronavirus . the person had the virus , but that doesn ' t mean they died from or due to it .
__label__0 i wanted to come in to work today but see , the coronavirus is in hamilton so i should stay home
__label__0 apparently there is weak immune memory when it comes to coronavirus . meaning we can easily get sick from slight mutations . basically we should expect annual coronavirus vaccines next to our annual flu shots .
__label__0 the coronavirus scare has my dad chastising me every time i go out to play magic like “ oooh you don ’ t know how many people they ’ ve been in contact with you shouldn ’ t go ” but work is fine gotta get them dollas and if i get sick it ’ s totally gonna be not b / c of work but magic yeah .
__label__0 not just you . i ' ve been a life long germaphobe and this is bringing me major anxiety . i feel sick to my stomach if reading all about this coronavirus . can ' t help but feel like i ' m gonna get infected . i ' m terrified !
__label__0 the line of bullshit that jr . & amp ; fox are feeding trump ' s base is sick af . i don ' t know a single person who " hopes " the coronavirus " comes here and kills millions of people " . . . not to end trump ' s " winning " or for any other reason . why do magas not see how disingenuous this is ? ?
__label__0 yall know there ’ s been an estimated 8 , 200 flu related deaths in the us this season and 140 , 000 hospitalizations . but continue with the coronavirus .
__label__0 bet on boris being infected by coronavirus . watch me cough outside downing street
__label__0 my dad has been sick and i said the same thing . coronavirus better stay out of ohio
__label__0 me when asked about my thoughts on social distancing # coronavirus # covid 19
__label__0 # coronavirus apparently we should all work from home . but schools not closing therefore teachers appear expendable .
__label__0 # coronavirus aside , i am amazed at how many grown folk i still see coughing and sneezing into their hands . it is beyond ridiculous that these folks refuse to evolve ! are you smarter than a 5 th grader ?
__label__0 i swear to god if i hear one more god damn joke of someone telling me i have coronavirus just bc i ’ m sick i ’ m going to fight
__label__0 we ' ve decided to let everyone at work remotely until the coronavirus settles down . it feels like the right thing to do , we work from home 2 days a week anyway so it puts our team + clients first . ultimately i ' d much rather be cautious & amp ; wrong than the other way around .
__label__0 my wrong well opinion is that the # coronavirus is not going away and is here to stay . i just went to the supermarket and goods are on the shelf as usual . my estimate is that there is 1 / 4 of the usual people . on the way back i met friends partying in a bar , like in boccaccio
__label__0 this girl in my texts thinkin i ’ m a cdc coronavirus expert bc i work at a major airport . . . i —
__label__0 i get you ' re concerned with the bottom line , i an concerned with my life . . . . and getting stuck on your ship . can i get my $ back ? # coronavirus # covid 19 # asthmatic # statedepartmentsaysno
__label__0 my parents are confined on the # grandprincess cruise ship . they are elderly , and i ’ m concerned about the lack of government communication / approach and about their health and the spread of # coronavirus please assist in any way to help bring them home safely .
__label__0 with coronavirus everywhere they say it ’ s best to quarantine yourself away from society like i haven ’ t been doing that for the last 5 years
__label__0 not worried about the coronavirus because i quarantine myself in my house anyway
__label__0 wash your hands ! live healthy ! a good defense against coronavirus is to keep washing your hands . i heard another doctor say that healthy people can get the coronavirus and survive just fine . so . . . if you can . . . live healthy !
__label__0 i ' m extremely concerned there are doctors in leftist controlled cities that would intentionally mis - diagnose a cold or flu as coronavirus . imagine the political fallout that would result . which party would benefit ? which would suffer greatly ? we already know both answers .
__label__0 interesting alert 🚨 my house in # mexico 🇲 🇽 sits in front of the pacific the cruise ships from america pass my front window every day the # princesscruises 🚢 ship has been # denied entrance into # mexico 🇲 🇽 from # sanfrancisco it ’ s on his way back right now can you say coronavirus
__label__0 finally got the call that we are all required to work from home due to concerns of coronavirus 🙌 🏼
__label__0 the potential economic impact of the coronavirus worries me . not as much as i ' m worried about the elderly , young , and ill who are and will be at serious risk , but enough to give me serious pause . imagine our cities coming to a stop as we all live in quarantine .
__label__0 i screamed fuck ! so loud at my desk when i saw this alert that one of my coworkers asked me if my mom had been diagnosed with coronavirus
__label__0 this might be my last tweet if i get coronavirus . some kids at my school just came back from italy and are at school today . wish me luck xd
__label__0 is trump stalling the test kits for the coronavirus and preventative measures so he can quarantine the us ( like is being done in other countries ) in november to prevent the elections and keep himself in the presidency ? this would be exactly how he and the republicans work .
__label__0 we are devoloping a more accurate system to detect people with fever at airports . i know you are allocating funds to fight coronavirus . would you listen to us and see how we can help with our technology ? ?
__label__0 you saw a totally different speech than every american . he ' s still issuing corrections . he flubbed lines . he looks like he has f * * * ing coronavirus . then again , you ' re one of the guys who went to russia on july 4 . so we know where your loyalties lie .
__label__0 agreed . only way minds really sway is massive trump scandal , coronavirus us quarantine / supply chain nightmare / stock market collapse , or dems catch 22 - fuck bernie even harder this time or nominate a socialist . betting markets & amp ; currency traders already baking in a trump victory
__label__0 it just gets worse . # coronavirus discovered on 14 of the 300 evacuees from # diamondprincess a little too late , group was on charter flight for us
__label__0 i work with these amazing people they ’ ve even invited me to contribute to this project . but despite that misjudgement i ’ ve never seen so many world class engineers , scientists , and medics work together so fast , so well for the common good . worth supporting ! # covid 19
__label__0 zahlt sich # coronavirus - test noch aus ? ja / nein ? - - - an asteroid capable of ending human civilisation if it hits will approach our planet in april , nasa ' s asteroid trackers have confirmed .
__label__0 there is a 75 % chance i will come out of this quarantine with front bangs # coronavirus
__label__0 i don ' t believe it would be responsible for me to go to sf . do i think ~ i ~ will get coronavirus ? no . or if i do , i think it ' s survivable . do i think i could spread it to others who might get sick if i do get it ? yes , and that would be bad . so ! want to commission an article ? hmu
__label__0 people are acting as if the virus can spread by making eye contact with someone im so confused its literally not that deadly and there are 96 % chance of coronavirus patients to fully recover 😐
__label__0 i agree . considering his age , his recent heart surgery , and his close contacts with thousands of people across the country , he ’ s very susceptible to the coronavirus . i ’ m not a doctor , but i think he ’ s pushing the envelope in regards to his health .
__label__0 # coronavirus gives our governments the perfect opportunity to restrict our rights , impose sweeping totalitarian actions , and unlawfully quarantine ( detain ) us indefinitely for the “ common good ” . . . democracy is more gravely threatened right now than the human race .
__label__0 you know that song my sharona well if you get sick during this pandemic you can be like “ my corona ”
__label__0 my office just put a work from home policy into effect until further notice . so that ’ s a thing . # coronavirus
__label__0 actually , if the patients are not being tested , the doctors are not assessing patients individually , and seems to me to be just assuming that it ' s not coronavirus . not good enough . no way would my children be having ibuprofen at the moment .
__label__0 just woke up having a sneezing fit . boyfriend asked if i drank a coronavirus last night . 🧐
__label__0 i don ’ t know , why don ’ t you tell me ? but i do know that we didn ’ t have a coronavirus during president obama ’ s time . and it was trump that gutted the cdc , that ’ s why we have not enough testing kits .
__label__0 i ' m sick . pls don ' t let it be the coronavirus lol
__label__0 can everyone please put a trigger warning on posts relating to # covid 19 . i know we need to alert people on the importance of # socialdistancing but some of the posts i ' ve seen are really distressing . # covid 19 ireland

__label__0 # suningcares suning has donated 600 , 000 pairs of latex medical gloves , and they ' re making their way to hospitals in # wuhan as we tweet . # coronavirus
__label__0 just a thought , if we get a vaccine for # coronavirus , would the anti - vaxxers of this world refuse to take it ? should we isolate all anti vaxxers right now ?
__label__0 one caution ( perhaps of many for google translate and farsi ) is the farsi for “ corona ” is translated as “ coronary heart disease ” not “ coronavirus ” . it confused me before ( thinking these might be hospitalized heart patients ) .
__label__0 i ' m seeing dr . natural at organic hospital today . i ' ll be on the subway , at the hospital , and in the city . my mom ' s warning me about the coronavirus . she ' s making me paranoid . obviously , that ' s the last thing i want but i believe she ' s overreacting at this point , so i ' m gonna go .

__label__0 i travel a lot and i ' d only seen airport warning signs about swine flu and coronavirus . i actually caught swine flu at a music festival in spain and that was no fun at all . loads of people were sick there . i think corona is definitely getting reported more than other viruses
__label__0 me enjoying aus decides while quarantined for coronavirus
__label__0 i think excellent healthcare conversation blog ( they decide to do a timely post on the coronavirus for it — should highlight the everett clinic ' s great reponse at the epicenter of the outbreak .
__label__0 i know that people have become super racist towards asians ever since the coronavirus was introduced , so now i just cough to see how people react 😇
__label__0 inside china ’ s all - out war on the coronavirus bruce aylward ' govt made it clear testing is free . in the us , that ’ s a barrier to speed . people think “ if i see my doctor , it ’ s going to cost me $ 100 . if i end up in the icu , what ’ s it going to cost me ? ” that ’ ll kill you . '
__label__0 i can attest to this as a flight attendant i ’ ve seen a lot of asian passengers using face masks way before coronavirus was ever a thing
__label__0 coronavirus is racist . im sick of it
__label__0 my message to everyone in the airport wearing dust masks to prevent the coronavirus thank you for saving me from having to look at your hideous countenance but that thing ain ' t doing shit . but seriously , thanks .
__label__0 us flying home americans stuck on quarantined ship in japan amid coronavirus outbreak
__label__0 this is ridiculous . why the fuck are we letting a plane load of selfish chinese land in kenya , a country that if an outbreak of coronavirus happens thousands will die . china has to take huge responsibility for not self containing this and letting the hoards still travel ! !
__label__0 flu and corona are very different in how they spread and infect . real question i would like answered is how long does the virus last in your body even with mild symptoms & amp ; contagious ? i had the flu many times , including h 1 n 1 . none lasted more than 3 days # coronavirus # pandemic

__label__0 we ’ ve done it for years over the flu . we did it when magic was diagnosed . i don ’ t see how the ( every year ) yearly death rate of the flu 20 - 40 k is less dangerous than a 2 k death rate ( worldwide ) of the coronavirus . and if we are afraid of the flu we need to get our bubbles ready . .
__label__0 how come non of the news stories concerning # coronavirus discusses nose picking ? i pick my nose constantly and i ' ve been wondering if it increases my chance of getting sick .
