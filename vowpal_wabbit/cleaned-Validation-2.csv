"be assed with this coronavirus, can’t even cough on me bus anymore without people thinking i’m infected 🥴",1
landed in #hongkong ard 7am. staff at echannel asked if i traveled from mainland china or #southkorea. i said no. that was it. there werent flights from either place at that hour so why ask &amp; why not check passport in case i had transited via another city? #coronavirus #covid19,1
the hospital has told me to quarantine in my house for two weeks because i probably have #coronavirus but he can’t test me because results take two weeks to get back. anyone know where i get buy a nintendo switch??,1
haven’t seen any yet. so far it’s been standard deplane and the passport scan at the kiosk. standing in line now to go through customs and speak to an agent. wasn’t any enhanced screening at  that i saw or experienced either #coronavirus ,0
