i think countries w / experience of outbreaks can respond well to # coronavirus . for the rest it ’ ll take time to get themselves organised . # zambia has a myriad of public health emergencies . testing aside , our other problem is clinic floor space , electricity generation , ventilators

it ' s great to live in a city , omaha , where one of our hospitals , unmc , is where desperately ill patients with ebola or coronavirus are sent for treatment . what ' s not great is that the only aca plan available here , medica , doesn ' t cover treatment there . # coronavirus
